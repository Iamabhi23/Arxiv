  Wang",Can We Solve 3D Vision Tasks Starting from A 2D Vision Transformer?,,,,,cs.CV cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Vision Transformers (ViTs) have proven to be effective, in solving 2D image
understanding tasks by training over large-scale image datasets; and meanwhile
as a somehow separate track, in modeling the 3D visual world too such as voxels
or point clouds. However, with the growing hope that transformers can become
the ""universal"" modeling tool for heterogeneous data, ViTs for 2D and 3D tasks
have so far adopted vastly different architecture designs that are hardly
transferable. That invites an (over-)ambitious question: can we close the gap
between the 2D and 3D ViT architectures? As a piloting study, this paper
demonstrates the appealing promise to understand the 3D visual world, using a
standard 2D ViT architecture, with only minimal customization at the input and
output levels without redesigning the pipeline. To build a 3D ViT from its 2D
sibling, we ""inflate"" the patch embedding and token sequence, accompanied with
new positional encoding mechanisms designed to match the 3D data geometry. The
resultant ""minimalist"" 3D ViT, named Simple3D-Former, performs surprisingly
robustly on popular 3D tasks such as object classification, point cloud
segmentation and indoor scene detection, compared to highly customized
3D-specific designs. It can hence act as a strong baseline for new 3D ViTs.
Moreover, we note that pursing a unified 2D-3D ViT design has practical
relevance besides just scientific curiosity. Specifically, we demonstrate that
Simple3D-Former naturally enables to exploit the wealth of pre-trained weights
from large-scale realistic 2D images (e.g., ImageNet), which can be plugged in
to enhancing the 3D task performance ""for free"".

  Classification",Technical report; 20 pages,,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Time series classification is an important problem in real world. Due to its
non-stationary property that the distribution changes over time, it remains
challenging to build models for generalization to unseen distributions. In this
paper, we propose to view the time series classification problem from the
distribution perspective. We argue that the temporal complexity attributes to
the unknown latent distributions within. To this end, we propose DIVERSIFY to
learn generalized representations for time series classification. DIVERSIFY
takes an iterative process: it first obtains the worst-case distribution
scenario via adversarial training, then matches the distributions of the
obtained sub-domains. We also present some theoretical insights. We conduct
experiments on gesture recognition, speech commands recognition, wearable
stress and affect detection, and sensor-based human activity recognition with a
total of seven datasets in different settings. Results demonstrate that
DIVERSIFY significantly outperforms other baselines and effectively
characterizes the latent distributions by qualitative and quantitative
analysis.

detailed information for accurate diagnosis and quantitative image analysis.
Despite the significant advances, most existing super-resolution (SR)
reconstruction network for medical images has two flaws: 1) All of them are
designed in a black-box principle, thus lacking sufficient interpretability and
further limiting their practical applications. Interpretable neural network
models are of significant interest since they enhance the trustworthiness
required in clinical practice when dealing with medical images. 2) most
existing SR reconstruction approaches only use a single contrast or use a
simple multi-contrast fusion mechanism, neglecting the complex relationships
between different contrasts that are critical for SR improvement. To deal with
these issues, in this paper, a novel Model-Guided interpretable Deep Unfolding
Network (MGDUN) for medical image SR reconstruction is proposed. The
Model-Guided image SR reconstruction approach solves manually designed
objective functions to reconstruct HR MRI. We show how to unfold an iterative
MGDUN algorithm into a novel model-guided deep unfolding network by taking the
MRI observation matrix and explicit multi-contrast relationship matrix into
account during the end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on the
multi-contrast IXI dataset and BraTs 2019 dataset demonstrate the superiority
of our proposed model.

  Pose Estimation",,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Event camera is an emerging bio-inspired vision sensors that report per-pixel
brightness changes asynchronously. It holds noticeable advantage of high
dynamic range, high speed response, and low power budget that enable it to best
capture local motions in uncontrolled environments. This motivates us to unlock
the potential of event cameras for human pose estimation, as the human pose
estimation with event cameras is rarely explored. Due to the novel paradigm
shift from conventional frame-based cameras, however, event signals in a time
interval contain very limited information, as event cameras can only capture
the moving body parts and ignores those static body parts, resulting in some
parts to be incomplete or even disappeared in the time interval. This paper
proposes a novel densely connected recurrent architecture to address the
problem of incomplete information. By this recurrent architecture, we can
explicitly model not only the sequential but also non-sequential geometric
consistency across time steps to accumulate information from previous frames to
recover the entire human bodies, achieving a stable and accurate human pose
estimation from event data. Moreover, to better evaluate our model, we collect
a large scale multimodal event-based dataset that comes with human pose
annotations, which is by far the most challenging one to the best of our
knowledge. The experimental results on two public datasets and our own dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness and strength of our approach. Code can be

mechanism design. A provider allocates multiple types of capacity-limited
resources to customers that arrive in a sequential and arbitrary manner. Each
customer has a private valuation function on bundles of resources that she can
purchase (e.g., a combination of different resources such as CPU and RAM in
cloud computing). The provider charges payment from customers who purchase a
bundle of resources and incurs an increasing supply cost with respect to the
totality of resources allocated. The goal is to maximize the social welfare,
namely, the total valuation of customers for their purchased bundles, minus the
total supply cost of the provider for all the resources that have been
allocated. We adopt the competitive analysis framework and provide posted-price
mechanisms with optimal competitive ratios. Our pricing mechanism is optimal in
the sense that no other online algorithms can achieve a better competitive
ratio. We validate the theoretic results via empirical studies of online
resource allocation in cloud computing. Our numerical results demonstrate that
the proposed pricing mechanism is competitive and robust against system
uncertainties and outperforms existing benchmarks.

approximating intractable distributions. However, its usage is limited in the
context of deep latent variable models owing to costly datapoint-wise sampling
iterations and slow convergence. This paper proposes the amortized Langevin
dynamics (ALD), wherein datapoint-wise MCMC iterations are entirely replaced
with updates of an encoder that maps observations into latent variables. This
amortization enables efficient posterior sampling without datapoint-wise
iterations. Despite its efficiency, we prove that ALD is valid as an MCMC
algorithm, whose Markov chain has the target posterior as a stationary
distribution under mild assumptions. Based on the ALD, we also present a new
deep latent variable model named the Langevin autoencoder (LAE). Interestingly,
the LAE can be implemented by slightly modifying the traditional autoencoder.
Using multiple synthetic datasets, we first validate that ALD can properly
obtain samples from target posteriors. We also evaluate the LAE on the image
generation task, and show that our LAE can outperform existing methods based on
variational inference, such as the variational autoencoder, and other
MCMC-based methods in terms of the test likelihood.

dimensionality when deriving policies to optimal control problems. For a given
system representation, i.e. the state variables and control inputs describing a
system, PoDec generates strategies to decompose the joint optimization of
policies for all control inputs. Thereby, policies for different inputs are
derived in a decoupled or cascaded fashion and as functions of some subsets of
the state variables, leading to reduction in computation. However, the choice
of system representation is crucial as it dictates the suboptimality of the
resulting policies. We present a heuristic method to find a representation more
amenable to decomposition. Our approach is based on the observation that every
decomposition enforces a sparsity pattern in the resulting policies at the cost
of optimality and a representation that already leads to a sparse optimal
policy is likely to produce decompositions with lower suboptimalities. As the
optimal policy is not known we construct a system representation that
sparsifies its LQR approximation. For a simplified biped, a 4 degree-of-freedom
manipulator, and a quadcopter, we discover decompositions that offer 10%
reduction in trajectory costs over those identified by vanilla PoDec. Moreover,
the decomposition policies produce trajectories with substantially lower costs
compared to policies obtained from state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
algorithms.

sensors for driving environment perception. The proposed algorithm comprises a
multi-task UNet (MTUNet) network for extracting image features and constrained

lane line segmentation, ego vehicle heading angle regression, road type

then take processed MTUNet outputs and radar data as their input to produce

controllers are shown to be more efficient than the sequential quadratic

In this paper, we conversely focus on unsupervised learning using probabilistic

accomplished by including a fairness penalty on the variational distribution

optimizing the variational parameters under this penalty. We first show the
utility of our method in improving equity and fairness for clustering using

particular, we show that label flipping is an effective pre-processing

optimization problem of minimally flipping labels given a limit to the
individual fairness violations, where a violation occurs when two similar

belongs to the family of agglutinative languages, it can be explained that the
automatic detection of stop words in the language is a more complex process
than in inflected languages. Moreover, we integrated our previous work on stop
words detection in the example of the ""School corpus"" by investigating how to
automatically analyse the detection of stop words in Uzbek texts. This work is
devoted to answering whether there is a good way of evaluating available stop
words for Uzbek texts, or whether it is possible to determine what part of the
Uzbek sentence contains the majority of the stop words by studying the
numerical characteristics of the probability of unique words. The results show
acceptable accuracy of the stop words lists.

an implicit assumption in this guarantee is that each agent is aware of the

lack high-level information. By introducing semantic information, SLAM can own
higher stability and robustness rather than purely hand-crafted features.
However, the high uncertainty of semantic detection networks prohibits the
practical functionality of high-level information. To solve the uncertainty
property introduced by semantics, this paper proposed a novel probability map
based on the Gaussian distribution assumption. This map transforms the semantic
binary object detection into probability results, which help establish a
probabilistic data association between artificial features and semantic info.
Through our algorithm, the higher confidence will be given higher weights in
each update step while the edge of the detection area will be endowed with
lower confidence. Then the uncertainty is undermined and has less effect on
nonlinear optimization. The experiments are carried out in the TUM RGBD

still non-trivial to determine. A natural idea is to compute the solution path
w.r.t. age parameter (i.e., age-path). However, current age-path algorithms are

database service outsourcing, where one can resort to the cloud to conveniently
store and query databases. Coming with such popular trend is the threat to data
privacy, as the cloud gains access to the databases and queries which may
contain sensitive information, like medical or financial data. A large body of
work has been presented for querying encrypted databases, which has been mostly
focused on secure keyword search. In this paper, we instead focus on the
support for secure skyline query processing over encrypted outsourced
databases, where little work has been done. Skyline query is an advanced kind
of database query which is important for multi-criteria decision-making systems
and applications. We propose SecSkyline, a new system framework building on
lightweight cryptography for fast privacy-preserving skyline queries.
SecSkyline ambitiously provides strong protection for not only the content
confidentiality of the outsourced database, the query, and the result, but also
for data patterns that may incur indirect data leakages, such as dominance
relationships among data points and search access patterns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SecSkyline is substantially superior to the
state-of-the-art in query latency, with up to 813$\times$ improvement.

high-quality dataset is expensive and time-consuming, thus the scale of the
training dataset is usually very small (e.g., SIGHAN15 only contains 2339
samples for training), therefore supervised-learning based models usually
suffer the data sparsity limitation and over-fitting issue, especially in the

introduced as the backbone model considering their powerful language diagnosis

These methods are typically based on learning with contrastive losses while
automatically deriving per-point pseudo-labels from a sparse set of
user-annotated labels. In this paper, our key observation is that the selection
of what samples to annotate is as important as how these samples are used for
training. Thus, we introduce a method for weakly supervised segmentation of 3D
scenes that combines self-training with active learning. The active learning
selects points for annotation that likely result in performance improvements to
the trained model, while the self-training makes efficient use of the
user-provided labels for learning the model. We demonstrate that our approach
leads to an effective method that provides improvements in scene segmentation

which re-weights the return of trajectories in the replay buffer to boost
sample efficiency. However, training with IS can be unstable and previous
attempts to address this issue mainly focus on analyzing the variance of IS. In
this paper, we reveal that the instability is also related to a new notion of
Reuse Bias of IS -- the bias in off-policy evaluation caused by the reuse of
the replay buffer for evaluation and optimization. We theoretically show that
the off-policy evaluation and optimization of the current policy with the data
from the replay buffer result in an overestimation of the objective, which may
cause an erroneous gradient update and degenerate the performance. We further
provide a high-probability upper bound of the Reuse Bias, and show that
controlling one term of the upper bound can control the Reuse Bias by
introducing the concept of stability for off-policy algorithms. Based on these
analyses, we finally present a novel Bias-Regularized Importance Sampling

their causative sources. Effective association must determine the number of
discrete events, their location and origin times, and it must differentiate
real arrivals from measurement artifacts. The advent of deep learning pickers,
which provide high rates of picks from closely overlapping small magnitude
earthquakes, motivates revisiting the phase association problem and approaching
it using the methods of deep learning. We have developed a Graph Neural Network
associator that simultaneously predicts both source space-time localization,
and discrete source-arrival association likelihoods. The method is applicable
to arbitrary geometry, time-varying seismic networks of hundreds of stations,
and is robust to high rates of sources and input picks with variable noise and
quality. Our Graph Earthquake Neural Interpretation Engine (GENIE) uses one
graph to represent the station set and another to represent the spatial source
region. GENIE learns relationships from data in this combined representation
that enable it to determine robust source and source-arrival associations. We
train on synthetic data, and test our method on real data from the Northern
California (NC) seismic network using input generated by the PhaseNet deep
learning phase picker. We successfully re-detect ~96% of all events M>1
reported by the USGS during 500 random days between 2000$\unicode{x2013}$2022.
Over a 100-day continuous interval of processing in 2017$\unicode{x2013}$2018,
we detect ~4.2x the number of events reported by the USGS. Our new events have
small magnitude estimates below the magnitude of completeness of the USGS
catalog, and are located close to the active faults and quarries in the region.
Our results demonstrate that GENIE can effectively solve the association
problem under complex seismic monitoring conditions.

multi-scale features for depth prediction via either straightforward
concatenation or element-wise addition, however, such feature aggregation
operations generally neglect the contextual consistency between multi-scale

Aggregation (SDFA) module for simultaneously aggregating a pair of low-scale

employs three branches to learn three feature offset maps respectively: one
offset map for refining the input low-scale feature and the other two for
refining the input high-scale feature under a designed self-distillation
manner. Then, we propose an SDFA-based network for self-supervised monocular
depth estimation, and design a self-distilled training strategy to train the
proposed network with the SDFA module. Experimental results on the KITTI

trade-off between two objectives that we call the ``seesaw'' problem: 1)
preserving reprojected contents and 2) completing realistic out-of-view
regions. Also, autoregressive models require a considerable computational cost.
In this paper, we propose a single-image view synthesis framework for
mitigating the seesaw problem. The proposed model is an efficient
non-autoregressive model with implicit and explicit renderers. Motivated by
characteristics that explicit methods well preserve reprojected pixels and
implicit methods complete realistic out-of-view region, we introduce a loss
function to complement two renderers. Our loss function promotes that explicit
features improve the reprojected area of implicit features and implicit
features improve the out-of-view area of explicit features. With the proposed
architecture and loss function, we can alleviate the seesaw problem,
outperforming autoregressive-based state-of-the-art methods and generating an

autoregressive latent video models have proved to be a powerful video

pre-training an image generator model, followed by learning an autoregressive
prediction model in the latent space of the image generator. However,
successfully generating high-fidelity and high-resolution videos has yet to be
seen. In this work, we investigate how to train an autoregressive latent video

modification to existing models, and produce high-resolution (256x256) videos.
Specifically, we scale up prior models by employing a high-fidelity image

techniques of top-k sampling and data augmentation to further improve video
prediction quality. Despite the simplicity, the proposed method achieves
competitive performance to state-of-the-art approaches on standard video

music generation, and a popular research direction is to study how to
effectively control the generation process. A straightforward way is to control
a model using different conditions during inference. However, in music
practice, conditions are usually sequential (rather than simple categorical
labels), involving rich information that overlaps with the learned
representation. Consequently, the decoder gets confused about whether to
""listen to"" the latent representation or the condition, and sometimes just
ignores the condition. To solve this problem, we leverage domain adversarial
training to disentangle the representation from condition cues for better
control. Specifically, we propose a condition corruption objective that uses
the representation to denoise a corrupted condition. Minimized by a
discriminator and maximized by the VAE encoder, this objective adversarially
induces a condition-invariant representation. In this paper, we focus on the
task of melody harmonization to illustrate our idea, while our methodology can
be generalized to other controllable generative tasks. Demos and experiments
show that our methodology facilitates not only condition-invariant
representation learning but also higher-quality controllability compared to
baselines.

optimization with logged data which consists of context, action, propensity

setting arises in many application domains, including advertising and
healthcare. While reward feedback is missing for some samples, it is possible
to leverage the unknown-reward samples in order to minimize the risk, and we
refer to this setting as semi-counterfactual risk minimization. To approach
this kind of learning problem, we derive new upper bounds on the true risk
under the inverse propensity score estimator. We then build upon these bounds
to propose a regularized counterfactual risk minimization method, where the
regularization term is based on the logged unknown-rewards dataset only; hence
it is reward-independent. We also propose another algorithm based on generating
pseudo-rewards for the logged unknown-rewards dataset. Experimental results
with neural networks and benchmark datasets indicate that these algorithms can
leverage the logged unknown-rewards dataset besides the logged known-reward

sequentially by optimizing a certain feedback. While the mean reward criterion
has been extensively studied, other measures that reflect an aversion to
adverse outcomes, such as mean-variance or conditional value-at-risk (CVaR),
can be of interest for critical applications (healthcare, agriculture).
Algorithms have been proposed for such risk-aware measures under bandit
feedback without contextual information. In this work, we study contextual
bandits where such risk measures can be elicited as linear functions of the
contexts through the minimization of a convex loss. A typical example that fits
within this framework is the expectile measure, which is obtained as the
solution of an asymmetric least-square problem. Using the method of mixtures
for supermartingales, we derive confidence sequences for the estimation of such
risk measures. We then propose an optimistic UCB algorithm to learn optimal
risk-aware actions, with regret guarantees similar to those of generalized
linear bandits. This approach requires solving a convex problem at each round
of the algorithm, which we can relax by allowing only approximated solution
obtained by online gradient descent, at the cost of slightly higher regret. We
conclude by evaluating the resulting algorithms on numerical experiments.

  variational inference",,,,,cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Variational Bayesian posterior inference often requires simplifying
approximations such as mean-field parametrisation to ensure tractability.
However, prior work has associated the variational mean-field approximation for
Bayesian neural networks with underfitting in the case of small datasets or
large model sizes. In this work, we show that invariances in the likelihood
function of over-parametrised models contribute to this phenomenon because
these invariances complicate the structure of the posterior by introducing
discrete and/or continuous modes which cannot be well approximated by Gaussian
mean-field distributions. In particular, we show that the mean-field
approximation has an additional gap in the evidence lower bound compared to a
purpose-built posterior that takes into account the known invariances.
Importantly, this invariance gap is not constant; it vanishes as the
approximation reverts to the prior. We proceed by first considering translation
invariances in a linear model with a single data point in detail. We show that,
while the true posterior can be constructed from a mean-field parametrisation,
this is achieved only if the objective function takes into account the
invariance gap. Then, we transfer our analysis of the linear model to neural
networks. Our analysis provides a framework for future work to explore
solutions to the invariance problem.

considered in eFS. FRBSs are seen as good solutions for big data and imbalanced
data, in the recent years the interpretability in FRBSs has gained popularity
due to high dimensional and big data and rules are initialized with cluster
centroids to limit the number of rules in FRBSs. This paper also highlights

to systematically reduce discrimination without significantly scarifies its
performance (i.e., accuracy). Multiple categories of fairness improving methods
have been proposed for neural networks, including pre-processing, in-processing
and post-processing. Our empirical study however shows that these methods are
not always effective (e.g., they may improve fairness by paying the price of
huge accuracy drop) or even not helpful (e.g., they may even worsen both
fairness and accuracy). In this work, we propose an approach which adaptively
chooses the fairness improving method based on causality analysis. That is, we
choose the method based on how the neurons and attributes responsible for
unfairness are distributed among the input attributes and the hidden neurons.
Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach is effective (i.e., always
identify the best fairness improving method) and efficient (i.e., with an
average time overhead of 5 minutes).

and localize tumor regions. However, variable tumor morphology, blurred
boundary, and similar intensity distributions bring challenges for accurate
segmentation of breast tumors. Recently, many U-net variants have been proposed
and widely used for breast tumors segmentation. However, these architectures
suffer from two limitations: (1) Ignoring the characterize ability of the
benchmark networks, and (2) Introducing extra complex operations increases the
difficulty of understanding and reproducing the network. To alleviate these
challenges, this paper proposes a simple yet powerful nested U-net (NU-net) for
accurate segmentation of breast tumors. The key idea is to utilize U-Nets with
different depths and shared weights to achieve robust characterization of
breast tumors. NU-net mainly has the following advantages: (1) Improving
network adaptability and robustness to breast tumors with different scales, (2)
This method is easy to reproduce and execute, and (3) The extra operations
increase network parameters without significantly increasing computational
cost. Extensive experimental results with twelve state-of-the-art segmentation
methods on three public breast ultrasound datasets demonstrate that NU-net has
more competitive segmentation performance on breast tumors. Furthermore, the
robustness of NU-net is further illustrated on the segmentation of renal
ultrasound images. The source code is publicly available on

simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Landmark management is necessary
in order to maintain a consistent map of the estimated landmarks relative to
the estimate of the platform's pose. This task is particularly important when
faced with multiple detections from the same landmark and/or dynamic
environments where the location of a landmark can change. A further challenge
with radar data is the presence of false detections. Accordingly, we propose a
simple yet efficient rule based solution for radar SLAM landmark management.
Assuming a low-dynamic environment, there are several steps in our solution:
new landmarks need to be detected and included, false landmarks need to be
identified and removed, and the consistency of the landmarks registered in the
map needs to be maintained. To illustrate our solution, we run an extended
Kalman filter SLAM algorithm in an environment containing both stationary and
temporally stationary landmarks. Our simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed solution is capable of reliably managing landmarks even when faced
with false detections and multiple detections from the same landmark.

estimation in robot swarms, clock synchronization for processor networks, and

estimations of their actual state can be obtained in a fully distributed manner
using algorithms such as affine averaging. However, running this algorithm,
requires that the agents exchange their current state estimations, which can be
a privacy issue (since they eventually reveal the actual states). To counteract
this threat, we propose an encrypted version of the affine averaging algorithm
in this paper. More precisely, we use homomorphic encryption to realize an
encrypted implementation, where only one ``leader'' agent has access to its
state estimation in plaintext. One main challenge (which often arises for
recursive encrypted computations) is to prevent overflow w.r.t.~the bounded
message space of the cryptosystem. We solve this problem by periodically
resetting the agents' states with the help of the leader. We study the
resulting system dynamics with respect to different reset strategies and
support our findings with extensive numerical simulations.

projection when the status of elements in the environment in the near future is
predicted. In cybersecurity situation awareness, the projection for an Advanced
Persistent Threat (APT) requires predicting the next step of the APT. The
threats are constantly changing and becoming more complex. As supervised and
unsupervised learning methods require APT datasets for projecting the next step
of APTs, they are unable to identify unknown APT threats. In reinforcement
learning methods, the agent interacts with the environment, and so it might
project the next step of known and unknown APTs. So far, reinforcement learning
has not been used to project the next step for APTs. In reinforcement learning,
the agent uses the previous states and actions to approximate the best action
of the current state. When the number of states and actions is abundant, the
agent employs a neural network which is called deep learning to approximate the
best action of each state. In this paper, we present a deep reinforcement
learning system to project the next step of APTs. As there exists some relation
between attack steps, we employ the Long- Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method to
approximate the best action of each state. In our proposed system, based on the

the influence of computing precision (single and double precision) on the

convergence) with double-precision as long as line search finds an improvement.
First-order methods such as RMSprop do not benefit from double precision.

computer vision and pattern recognition society. Recently, due to the advances
in deep learning, the FR technology shows high performance for most of the
benchmark datasets. However, when the FR algorithm is applied to a real-world
scenario, the performance has been known to be still unsatisfactory. This is
mainly attributed to the mismatch between training and testing sets. Among such
mismatches, face misalignment between training and testing faces is one of the
factors that hinder successful FR. To address this limitation, we propose a
face shape-guided deep feature alignment framework for FR robust to the face
misalignment. Based on a face shape prior (e.g., face keypoints), we train the
proposed deep network by introducing alignment processes, i.e., pixel and
feature alignments, between well-aligned and misaligned face images. Through
the pixel alignment process that decodes the aggregated feature extracted from
a face image and face shape prior, we add the auxiliary task to reconstruct the
well-aligned face image. Since the aggregated features are linked to the face
feature extraction network as a guide via the feature alignment process, we
train the robust face feature to the face misalignment. Even if the face shape
estimation is required in the training stage, the additional face alignment
process, which is usually incorporated in the conventional FR pipeline, is not
necessarily needed in the testing phase. Through the comparative experiments,
we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the face misalignment
with the FR datasets.

multiple transformers with a low number of heads (such as one or two). In

to form building blocks for describing the domain at a three levels of

  Sub-THz Networks: A Resources-based Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization
  DRL with Attention Mechanism","13 pages, 12 figures",,,,cs.NI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  THz band communication technology will be used in the 6G networks to enable
high-speed and high-capacity data service demands. However, THz-communication
losses arise owing to limitations, i.e., molecular absorption, rain
attenuation, and coverage range. Furthermore, to maintain steady
THz-communications and overcome coverage distances in rural and suburban
regions, the required number of BSs is very high. Consequently, a new
communication platform that enables aerial communication services is required.
Furthermore, the airborne platform supports LoS communications rather than NLoS
communications, which helps overcome these losses. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate the deployment and resource optimization for MEC-enabled UAVs,
which can provide THz-based communications in remote regions. To this end, we
formulate an optimization problem to minimize the sum of the energy consumption
of both MEC-UAV and MUs and the delay incurred by MUs under the given task
information. The formulated problem is a MINLP problem, which is NP-hard. We
decompose the main problem into two subproblems to address the formulated
problem. We solve the first subproblem with a standard optimization solver,
i.e., CVXPY, due to its convex nature. To solve the second subproblem, we
design a RMAPPO DRL algorithm with an attention mechanism. The considered
attention mechanism is utilized for encoding a diverse number of observations.
This is designed by the network coordinator to provide a differentiated fit
reward to each agent in the network. The simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark and yields a network utility which
is $2.22\%$, $15.55\%$, and $17.77\%$ more than the benchmarks.

distributed setting under both computational and communication constraints.
Specifically, we consider a star topology network whereby several machines are
connected to a fusion center, with whom they can exchange relatively short
messages. Each machine holds noisy samples from a linear regression model with
the same unknown sparse $d$-dimensional vector of regression coefficients
$\theta$. The goal of the fusion center is to estimate the vector $\theta$ and
its support using few computations and limited communication at each machine.
In this work, we consider distributed algorithms based on Orthogonal Matching
Pursuit (OMP) and theoretically study their ability to exactly recover the
support of $\theta$. We prove that under certain conditions, even at low
signal-to-noise-ratios where individual machines are unable to detect the
support of $\theta$, distributed-OMP methods correctly recover it with total
communication sublinear in $d$. In addition, we present simulations that
illustrate the performance of distributed OMP-based algorithms and show that
they perform similarly to more sophisticated and computationally intensive
methods, and in some cases even outperform them.

motion during the acquisition poses unique challenges: Non-rigid, discontinuous
distortions can occur, leading to gaps in data and distorted topographic
measurements. We present a new distortion model and a corresponding
fully-automatic, reference-free optimization strategy for computational motion
correction in orthogonally raster-scanned, retinal OCT volumes. Using a novel,
domain-specific spatiotemporal parametrization of forward-warping
displacements, eye motion can be corrected continuously for the first time.
Parameter estimation with temporal regularization improves robustness and
accuracy over previous spatial approaches. We correct each A-scan individually
in 3D in a single mapping, including repeated acquisitions used in OCT
angiography protocols. Specialized 3D forward image warping reduces median
runtime to < 9 s, fast enough for clinical use. We present a quantitative
evaluation on 18 subjects with ocular pathology and demonstrate accurate
correction during microsaccades. Transverse correction is limited only by
ocular tremor, whereas submicron repeatability is achieved axially (0.51 um

This allows assessing longitudinal changes in focal retinal pathologies as a
marker of disease progression or treatment response, and promises to enable
multiple new capabilities such as supersampled/super-resolution volume
reconstruction and analysis of pathological eye motion occuring in neurological

two protocols are investigated. For classic controllability, the multiplicity
of eigenvalue zero of general Laplacian matrix $L^*$ is shown to be determined
by the sum of the numbers of zero circles, identical nodes and opposite pairs,
while it is always simple for the Laplacian $L$ with diagonal entries in
absolute form. For a fixed structurally balanced topology, the controllable
subspace is proved to be invariant even if the antagonistic weights are
selected differently under the corresponding protocol with $L$. For a graph
expanded from a star graph rooted from a single leader, the dimension of
controllable subspace is two under the protocol associated with $L^*$. In
addition, the system is structurally controllable under both protocols if and
only if the topology without unaccessible nodes is connected. As a reinforcing
case of structural controllability, strong structural controllability requires
the system to be controllable for any choice of weights. The connection between
father nodes and child nodes affects strong structural controllability because
it determines the linear relationship of the control information from father
nodes. This discovery is a major factor in establishing the sufficient
conditions on strong structural controllability for multi-agent systems under
both protocols, rather than for complex networks, about latter results are
already abundant.

as well. Here, in order to meet this paramount call, we propose two types of
controllers, viz., the exponential stabilizer (ES) based on the stochastic
Lyapunov theory and the asymptotic stabilizer (AS) based on the stochastic
asymptotic stability theory. The ES can render the controlled systems
exponentially convergent but it requires a long computational time; conversely,
the AS makes the training much faster but it can only assure the asymptotic
(not the exponential) attractiveness of the control targets. These two
stochastic controllers thus are complementary in applications. We also
investigate rigorously the linear controller and the proposed neural stochastic
controllers in both convergence time and energy cost and numerically compare
them in these two indexes. More significantly, we use several representative
physical systems to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed controllers in
stabilization of dynamical systems.

  optimization for fair misinformation detection",,,,,cs.LG cs.CY math.OC,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Multiple-objective optimization (MOO) aims to simultaneously optimize
multiple conflicting objectives and has found important applications in machine
learning, such as minimizing classification loss and discrepancy in treating
different populations for fairness. At optimality, further optimizing one
objective will necessarily harm at least another objective, and decision-makers
need to comprehensively explore multiple optima (called Pareto front) to
pinpoint one final solution. We address the efficiency of finding the Pareto
front. First, finding the front from scratch using stochastic multi-gradient
descent (SMGD) is expensive with large neural networks and datasets. We propose
to explore the Pareto front as a manifold from a few initial optima, based on a
predictor-corrector method. Second, for each exploration step, the predictor
solves a large-scale linear system that scales quadratically in the number of
model parameters and requires one backpropagation to evaluate a second-order
Hessian-vector product per iteration of the solver. We propose a Gauss-Newton
approximation that only scales linearly, and that requires only first-order
inner-product per iteration. This also allows for a choice between the MINRES
and conjugate gradient methods when approximately solving the linear system.
The innovations make predictor-corrector possible for large networks.
Experiments on multi-objective (fairness and accuracy) misinformation detection
tasks show that 1) the predictor-corrector method can find Pareto fronts better
than or similar to SMGD with less time; and 2) the proposed first-order method
does not harm the quality of the Pareto front identified by the second-order
method, while further reduce running time.

these issues, we propose a Structure-Aware Cross-Attention (SACA) mechanism to

SACA and introduce its variant Dynamic Graph Pruning (DGP) mechanism to

assembly planning, which is otherwise a labor-intensive and daunting task.
Assembling furniture is especially interesting since furniture are intricate
and pose challenges for learning-based approaches. Surprisingly, humans can
solve furniture assembly mostly given a 2D snapshot of the assembled product.
Although recent years have witnessed promising learning-based approaches for
furniture assembly, they assume the availability of correct connection labels
for each assembly step, which are expensive to obtain in practice. In this
paper, we alleviate this assumption and aim to solve furniture assembly with as
little human expertise and supervision as possible. To be specific, we assume
the availability of the assembled point cloud, and comparing the point cloud of
the current assembly and the point cloud of the target product, obtain a novel
reward signal based on two measures: Incorrectness and incompleteness. We show
that our novel reward signal can train a deep network to successfully assemble
different types of furniture. Code and networks available here:

channel conditions and a steadily rising number of users and devices. This, and
the still rising bandwidth demands, can only be met by intelligent network
automation, which requires highly flexible and blind transceiver algorithms. To
tackle those challenges, we propose a novel adaptive equalization scheme, which
exploits the prosperous advances in deep learning by training an equalizer with
an adversarial network. The learning is only based on the statistics of the
transmit signal, so it is blind regarding the actual transmit symbols and
agnostic to the channel model. The proposed approach is independent of the
equalizer topology and enables the application of powerful neural network based
equalizers. In this work, we prove this concept in simulations of different --
both linear and nonlinear -- transmission channels and demonstrate the
capability of the proposed blind learning scheme to approach the performance of
non-blind equalizers. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical perspective and
highlight the challenges of the approach.

shaping in value-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We show that reward
shifting in the form of the linear transformation is equivalent to changing the
initialization of the $Q$-function in function approximation. Based on such an
equivalence, we bring the key insight that a positive reward shifting leads to
conservative exploitation, while a negative reward shifting leads to
curiosity-driven exploration. Accordingly, conservative exploitation improves
offline RL value estimation, and optimistic value estimation improves
exploration for online RL. We validate our insight on a range of RL tasks and
show its improvement over baselines: (1) In offline RL, the conservative
exploitation leads to improved performance based on off-the-shelf algorithms;
(2) In online continuous control, multiple value functions with different
shifting constants can be used to tackle the exploration-exploitation dilemma
for better sample efficiency; (3) In discrete control tasks, a negative reward
shifting yields an improvement over the curiosity-based exploration method.

learning techniques is rapidly growing in the field of computational solid
mechanics. Their application is especially advantageous in concurrent
multiscale finite element analysis (FE$^2$) due to the exceedingly high
computational costs often associated with it and the high number of similar
micromechanical analyses involved. To tackle the issue, using surrogate models
to approximate the microscopic behavior and accelerate the simulations is a
promising and increasingly popular strategy. However, several challenges
related to their data-driven nature compromise the reliability of surrogate
models in material modeling. The alternative explored in this work is to
reintroduce some of the physics-based knowledge of classical constitutive
modeling into a neural network by employing the actual material models used in
the full-order micromodel to introduce non-linearity. Thus, path-dependency
arises naturally since every material model in the layer keeps track of its own
internal variables. For the numerical examples, a composite Representative
Volume Element with elastic fibers and elasto-plastic matrix material is used
as the microscopic model. The network is tested in a series of challenging
scenarios and its performance is compared to that of a state-of-the-art
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A remarkable outcome of the novel framework is
the ability to naturally predict unloading/reloading behavior without ever
seeing it during training, a stark contrast with popular but data-hungry models
such as RNNs. Finally, the proposed network is applied to FE$^2$ examples to
assess its robustness for application in nonlinear finite element analysis.

suboptimal treatment arms as parameters of interest, and all other parameters,

of the random sampling (RS) rule tracking a target allocation ratio and the

focused increasingly on the privacy of deep learning models and how to prevent
attackers from obtaining sensitive information about the training data.
However, image-text models like CLIP have not yet been looked at in the context
of privacy attacks. While membership inference attacks aim to tell whether a
specific data point was used for training, we introduce a new type of privacy
attack, named identity inference attack (IDIA), designed for multi-modal
image-text models like CLIP. Using IDIAs, an attacker can reveal whether a
particular person, was part of the training data by querying the model in a
black-box fashion with different images of the same person. Letting the model
choose from a wide variety of possible text labels, the attacker can probe the
model whether it recognizes the person and, therefore, was used for training.
Through several experiments on CLIP, we show that the attacker can identify
individuals used for training with very high accuracy and that the model learns
to connect the names with the depicted people. Our experiments show that a
multi-modal image-text model indeed leaks sensitive information about its
training data and, therefore, should be handled with care.

Round-trip translation provides an encouraging way to alleviate the urgent
requirement of the parallel corpus, although it was unfortunately not observed
to correlate with forwarding translation in the era of statistical machine
translation. In this paper, we firstly observe that forward translation quality
consistently correlates to corresponding round-trip translation quality in the

environments. Fortunately, a complex system can be divided into multiple
modular structures that human cognition appears to exploit. Inspired by this
cognition, a novel control method, Causal Coupled Mechanisms (CCMs), is
proposed that explores the cooperation in division and competition in
combination. Our method employs the theory of hierarchical reinforcement
learning (HRL), in which 1) the high-level policy with competitive awareness
divides the whole complex system into multiple functional mechanisms, and 2)
the low-level policy finishes the control task of each mechanism. Specifically
for cooperation, a cascade control module helps the series operation of CCMs,
and a forward coupled reasoning module is used to recover the coupling
information lost in the division process. On both synthetic systems and a
real-world biological regulatory system, the CCM method achieves robust and

Moreover, generalization results show that reusing prepared specialized CCMs

talent is a random variable distributed identically for everyone, but wealth is
a random variable that is dependent on the population one is born into.
Individuals then apply to a downstream agent, which we treat as a university
throughout the paper (but could also represent an employer) who makes a
decision about whether to admit them or not. The university does not directly
observe talent or wealth, but rather a signal (representing e.g. a standardized
test) that is a convex combination of both. The university knows the
distributions from which an individual's type and wealth are drawn, and makes
its decisions based on the posterior distribution of the applicant's
characteristics conditional on their population and signal. Each population's
wealth distribution at the next round then depends on the fraction of that
population that was admitted by the university at the previous round.
  We study wealth dynamics in this model, and give conditions under which the

inequality is transitory), and conditions under which it can have multiple

in reinforcement learning (RL) with the $\epsilon$-greedy exploration under the

Q-networks (DQN) framework that falls in this regime. In this work, we provide
an initial attempt on theoretical understanding deep RL from the perspective of
function class and neural networks architectures (e.g., width and depth) beyond
the ""linear"" regime. To be specific, we focus on the value based algorithm with
the $\epsilon$-greedy exploration via deep (and two-layer) neural networks
endowed by Besov (and Barron) function spaces, respectively, which aims at
approximating an $\alpha$-smooth Q-function in a $d$-dimensional feature space.
We prove that, with $T$ episodes, scaling the width $m =
\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{\frac{d}{2\alpha + d}})$ and the depth
$L=\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ of the neural network for deep RL is sufficient for
learning with sublinear regret in Besov spaces. Moreover, for a two layer
neural network endowed by the Barron space, scaling the width
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ is sufficient. To achieve this, the key issue in our
analysis is how to estimate the temporal difference error under deep neural
function approximation as the $\epsilon$-greedy exploration is not enough to
ensure ""optimism"". Our analysis reformulates the temporal difference error in
an $L^2(\mathrm{d}\mu)$-integrable space over a certain averaged measure $\mu$,
and transforms it to a generalization problem under the non-iid setting. This
might have its own interest in RL theory for better understanding
$\epsilon$-greedy exploration in deep RL.

surprisingly effective network for large-scale visual recognition, by
revisiting Nearest Centroids, one of the most classic and simple classifiers.
Current deep models learn the classifier in a fully parametric manner, ignoring
the latent data structure and lacking simplicity and explainability. DNC
instead conducts nonparametric, case-based reasoning; it utilizes sub-centroids
of training samples to describe class distributions and clearly explains the
classification as the proximity of test data and the class sub-centroids in the
feature space. Due to the distance-based nature, the network output
dimensionality is flexible, and all the learnable parameters are only for data
embedding. That means all the knowledge learnt for ImageNet classification can
be completely transferred for pixel recognition learning, under the
""pre-training and fine-tuning"" paradigm. Apart from its nested simplicity and
intuitive decision-making mechanism, DNC can even possess ad-hoc explainability
when the sub-centroids are selected as actual training images that humans can
view and inspect. Compared with parametric counterparts, DNC performs better on
image classification (CIFAR-10, ImageNet) and greatly boots pixel recognition
(ADE20K, Cityscapes), with improved transparency and fewer learnable
parameters, using various network architectures (ResNet, Swin) and segmentation
models (FCN, DeepLabV3, Swin). We feel this work brings fundamental insights
into related fields.

the dual of the relaxed allocation problem are used in practice. However, these

goals that can be conflicting. The trade-offs can be substantial, and we
establish that the design of pricing rules is fundamentally a multi-objective
optimization problem addressing different incentives. In addition to
traditional multi-objective optimization techniques using weighing of
individual objectives, we introduce a novel parameter-free pricing rule that
minimizes incentives for market participants to deviate locally. Our findings
show how the new pricing rule capitalizes on the upsides of existing pricing
rules under scrutiny today. It leads to prices that incur low make-whole
payments while providing adequate congestion signals and low lost opportunity
costs. Our suggested pricing rule does not require weighing of objectives, it
is computationally scalable, and balances trade-offs in a principled manner,
addressing an important policy issue in electricity markets.

cumbersome and lengthy, considering that a new calibration is required each

online method for the extrinsic calibration of multiple smart edge sensors,
relying solely on 2D human keypoint detections that are computed locally on the
sensor boards from RGB camera images. Our method assumes the intrinsic camera
parameters to be known and requires priming with a rough initial estimate of
the camera poses. The person keypoint detections from multiple views are
received at a central backend where they are synchronized, filtered, and
assigned to person hypotheses. We use these person hypotheses to repeatedly
solve optimization problems in the form of factor graphs. Given suitable
observations of one or multiple persons traversing the scene, the estimated
camera poses converge towards a coherent extrinsic calibration within a few

from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RCTs estimate the average effect of
one treatment versus another in a certain population. However, treatments may
not be equally effective for every patient in a population. Knowing the
effectiveness of treatments tailored to specific patient and tumor
characteristics would enable individualized treatment decisions. Getting
tailored treatment effects by averaging outcomes in different patient subgroups
in RCTs requires an unfeasible number of patients to have sufficient
statistical power in all relevant subgroups for all possible treatments.
  The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) recommends that researchers
develop outcome prediction models (OPMs) in an effort to individualize
treatment decisions. OPMs sometimes called risk models or prognosis models, use
patient and tumor characteristics to predict a patient outcome such as overall
survival. The assumption is that the predictions are useful for treatment
decisions using rules such as ""prescribe chemotherapy only if the OPM predicts
the patient has a high risk of recurrence"". Recognizing the importance of
reliable predictions, the AJCC published a checklist for OPMs to ensure
dependable OPM prediction accuracy in the patient population for which the OPM
was designed. However, accurate outcome predictions do not imply that these
predictions yield good treatment decisions. In this perspective, we show that
OPM rely on a fixed treatment policy which implies that OPM that were found to
accurately predict outcomes in validation studies can still lead to patient
harm when used to inform treatment decisions. We then give guidance on how to
develop models that are useful for individualized treatment decisions and how
to evaluate whether a model has value for decision-making.

underlying architecture for improving the adversarial robustness of machine
learning models against evasion attacks. While earlier works have focused on
improving Convolutional Neural Networks, we show that also ViTs are highly
suitable for adversarial training to achieve competitive performance. We
achieve this objective using a custom adversarial training recipe, discovered
using rigorous ablation studies on a subset of the ImageNet dataset. The
canonical training recipe for ViTs recommends strong data augmentation, in part
to compensate for the lack of vision inductive bias of attention modules, when
compared to convolutions. We show that this recipe achieves suboptimal
performance when used for adversarial training. In contrast, we find that
omitting all heavy data augmentation, and adding some additional bag-of-tricks
($\varepsilon$-warmup and larger weight decay), significantly boosts the
performance of robust ViTs. We show that our recipe generalizes to different
classes of ViT architectures and large-scale models on full ImageNet-1k.
Additionally, investigating the reasons for the robustness of our models, we
show that it is easier to generate strong attacks during training when using
our recipe and that this leads to better robustness at test time. Finally, we
further study one consequence of adversarial training by proposing a way to
quantify the semantic nature of adversarial perturbations and highlight its
correlation with the robustness of the model. Overall, we recommend that the
community should avoid translating the canonical training recipes in ViTs to
robust training and rethink common training choices in the context of
adversarial training.

directly handle numerical features, in contrast to a number of related prior
approaches which require numerical features to be first converted into {high
cardinality} categorical features via {a binning strategy}. Higher binning
granularity is required for better accuracy, but this negatively impacts
scalability. Eliminating the need for binning allows us to produce synthetic
data preserving large numbers of statistical queries such as marginals on
numerical features, and class conditional linear threshold queries. Preserving
the latter means that the fraction of points of each class label above a
particular half-space is roughly the same in both the real and synthetic data.
This is the property that is needed to train a linear classifier in a multitask
setting. Our algorithm also allows us to produce high quality synthetic data
for mixed marginal queries, that combine both categorical and numerical
features. Our method consistently runs 2-5x faster than the best comparable
techniques, and provides significant accuracy improvements in both marginal

  Rates for (Non-Smooth) Convex Losses and Extension to Non-Convex Losses",,,,,cs.LG cs.CR math.OC stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We study differentially private (DP) stochastic optimization (SO) with data
containing outliers and loss functions that are not Lipschitz continuous. To
date, the vast majority of work on DP SO assumes that the loss is Lipschitz
(i.e. stochastic gradients are uniformly bounded), and their error bounds scale
with the Lipschitz parameter of the loss. While this assumption is convenient,
it is often unrealistic: in many practical problems where privacy is required,
data may contain outliers or be unbounded, causing some stochastic gradients to
have large norm. In such cases, the Lipschitz parameter may be prohibitively
large, leading to vacuous excess risk bounds. Thus, building on a recent line
of work [WXDX20, KLZ22], we make the weaker assumption that stochastic
gradients have bounded $k$-th moments for some $k \geq 2$. Compared with works
on DP Lipschitz SO, our excess risk scales with the $k$-th moment bound instead
of the Lipschitz parameter of the loss, allowing for significantly faster rates
in the presence of outliers. For convex and strongly convex loss functions, we
provide the first asymptotically optimal excess risk bounds (up to a
logarithmic factor). Moreover, in contrast to the prior works [WXDX20, KLZ22],
our bounds do not require the loss function to be differentiable/smooth. We
also devise an accelerated algorithm that runs in linear time and yields
improved (compared to prior works) and nearly optimal excess risk for smooth
losses. Additionally, our work is the first to address non-convex non-Lipschitz
loss functions satisfying the Proximal-PL inequality; this covers some classes
of neural nets, among other practical models. Our Proximal-PL algorithm has
nearly optimal excess risk that almost matches the strongly convex lower bound.
Lastly, we provide shuffle DP variations of our algorithms, which do not
require a trusted curator (e.g. for distributed learning).

this expensive training routine, zero-shot/cost proxies analyze an NN at

multiple cycles of empirical testing on possible algorithms, data-sets, and

reconstruct subtyping information uncovered at runtime during pattern matching.
We introduce cDOT, a new calculus in the family of Dependent Object Types (DOT)
intended to serve as a formal foundation for subtyping reconstruction. Being
descended from pDOT, itself a formal foundation for Scala, cDOT can be used to
encode advanced object-oriented features such as generic inheritance, type
constructor variance, F-bounded polymorphism, and first-class recursive
modules. We demonstrate that subtyping reconstruction subsumes GADTs by
encoding $\lambda_{2,G\mu}$, a classical constraint-based GADT calculus, into
cDOT.

Consequently, the learned relationship between the input and the output must

the retraining or rebuilding of the model is required. We propose to consider

general stochastic sequence, including i.i.d noise and random walk on an
arbitrary graph, among others; and analyze it in the asymptotic sense.
Specifically, we employ the notion of `efficiency ordering', a well-analyzed
tool for comparing the performance of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers,
for SGD algorithms in the form of Loewner ordering of covariance matrices
associated with the scaled iterate errors in the long term. Using this
ordering, we show that input sequences that are more efficient for MCMC
sampling also lead to smaller covariance of the errors for SGD algorithms in
the limit. This also suggests that an arbitrarily weighted MSE of SGD iterates
in the limit becomes smaller when driven by more efficient chains. Our finding
is of particular interest in applications such as decentralized optimization
and swarm learning, where SGD is implemented in a random walk fashion on the
underlying communication graph for cost issues and/or data privacy. We
demonstrate how certain non-Markovian processes, for which typical mixing-time
based non-asymptotic bounds are intractable, can outperform their Markovian
counterparts in the sense of efficiency ordering for SGD. We show the utility
of our method by applying it to gradient descent with shuffling and mini-batch
gradient descent, reaffirming key results from existing literature under a
unified framework. Empirically, we also observe efficiency ordering for
variants of SGD such as accelerated SGD and Adam, open up the possibility of
extending our notion of efficiency ordering to a broader family of stochastic
optimization algorithms.

the stake-governed games introduced recently in [HP2022]. We call the new game
the Trail of Lost Pennies. At time zero, a counter is placed at a given integer
location: $X_0 = k \in \mathbb{Z}$, say. At the $i$-th turn (for $i \in
\mathbb{N}_+$), Maxine and Mina place non-negative stakes, $a_i$ and $b_i$, for
which each pays from her own savings. Maxine is declared to be the turn victor
with probability $\tfrac{a_i}{a_i+b_i}$; otherwise, Mina is. If Maxine wins the
turn, she will move the counter one place to the right, so that $X_i = X_{i-1}
+1$; if Mina does so, the counter will move one place to the left, so that $X_i
= X_{i-1} -1$. If $\liminf X_i = \infty$, then Maxine wins the game; if
$\limsup X_i = -\infty$, then Mina does. (A special rule is needed to treat the
remaining, indeterminate, case.) When Maxine wins, she receives a terminal
payment of $m_\infty$, while Mina receives $n_\infty$. If Mina wins, these
respective receipts are $m_{-\infty}$ and $n_{-\infty}$. The four terminal
payment values are supposed to be real numbers that satisfy $m_\infty >
m_{-\infty}$ and $n_\infty < n_{-\infty}$, where these bounds accord with the
notion that Maxine wins when the counter ends far to the right, and that Mina
does so when it reaches far to the left. Each player is motivated to offer
stakes at each turn of the game, in order to secure the higher terminal payment
that will arise from her victory; but since these stake amounts accumulate to
act as a cost depleting the profit arising from victory, each player must also
seek to control these expenses. In this article, we study the Trail of Lost
Pennies, formulating strategies for the two players and defining and analysing
Nash equilibria in the game.

achieving small cumulative constraints violation across the $T$ rounds. We
present the first best-of-both-world type algorithm for this general class of
problems, with no-regret guarantees both in the case in which rewards and
constraints are selected according to an unknown stochastic model, and in the
case in which they are selected at each round by an adversary. Our algorithm is
the first to provide guarantees in the adversarial setting with respect to the
optimal fixed strategy that satisfies the long-term constraints. In particular,
it guarantees a $\rho/(1+\rho)$ fraction of the optimal reward and sublinear
regret, where $\rho$ is a feasibility parameter related to the existence of
strictly feasible solutions. Our framework employs traditional regret
minimizers as black-box components. Therefore, by instantiating it with an

seamlessly handle scenarios with non-convex rewards and constraints. We show

the continuous couplings having strengths that are inherited from the fitness

learning a predictor based on a known loss function, omnipredictors can easily
be post-processed to minimize any one of a rich family of loss functions
compared with the loss of a class $C$. It has been shown that such
omnipredictors exist and are implied (for all convex and Lipschitz loss
functions) by the notion of multicalibration from the algorithmic fairness
literature. Nevertheless, it is often the case that the action selected must
obey some additional constraints (such as capacity or parity constraints). In
itself, the original notion of omnipredictors does not apply in this
well-motivated and heavily studied the context of constrained loss
minimization.
  In this paper, we introduce omnipredictors for constrained optimization and
study their complexity and implications. The notion that we introduce allows
the learner to be unaware of the loss function that will be later assigned as
well as the constraints that will be later imposed, as long as the
subpopulations that are used to define these constraints are known.
  The paper shows how to obtain omnipredictors for constrained optimization
problems, relying on appropriate variants of multicalibration. For some
interesting constraints and general loss functions and for general constraints
and some interesting loss functions, we show how omnipredictors are implied by
a variant of multicalibration that is similar in complexity to standard
multicalibration. We demonstrate that in the general case, standard
multicalibration is insufficient and show that omnipredictors are implied by
multicalibration with respect to a class containing all the level sets of
hypotheses in $C$. We also investigate the implications when the constraints
are group fairness notions.

contracts with application to correct-by-construction design of vehicular
mission plans. In our approach, a mission-level specification expressed in a
fragment of signal temporal logic (STL) is decomposed into predicates defined
on non-overlapping time intervals. The STL predicates are then mapped to an
aggregation of contracts associated with continuously differentiable
time-varying control barrier functions. The barrier functions are used to
constrain the lower-level control synthesis problem, which is solved via
quadratic programming. Our approach can avoid the conservatism of previous
methods for task-driven control based on under-approximations. We illustrate
its effectiveness on a case study motivated by vehicular mission planning under
safety constraints as well as constraints imposed by traffic regulations under
vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication.

that self-attention scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which in
turn, scales quadratically with the image size. On larger images (e.g., 1080p),
over 60% of the total computation in the network is spent solely on creating
and applying attention matrices. We take a step toward solving this issue by
introducing Hydra Attention, an extremely efficient attention operation for
Vision Transformers (ViTs). Paradoxically, this efficiency comes from taking
multi-head attention to its extreme: by using as many attention heads as there
are features, Hydra Attention is computationally linear in both tokens and
features with no hidden constants, making it significantly faster than standard
self-attention in an off-the-shelf ViT-B/16 by a factor of the token count.
Moreover, Hydra Attention retains high accuracy on ImageNet and, in some cases,
actually improves it.

Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RBPFs), which exactly solve inference
problems when possible and fall back on sampling approximations when necessary.
While RBPFs can be implemented by hand to provide efficient inference, the goal
of streaming probabilistic programming is to automatically generate such
efficient inference implementations given input probabilistic programs.
  In this work, we propose semi-symbolic inference, a technique for executing
probabilistic programs using a runtime inference system that automatically

approximate inference together, the semi-symbolic inference system manipulates
symbolic distributions to perform exact inference when possible and falls back
on approximate sampling when necessary. This approach enables the system to
implement the same RBPF a developer would write by hand. To ensure this, we
identify closed families of distributions -- such as linear-Gaussian and finite
discrete models -- on which the inference system guarantees exact inference. We
have implemented the runtime inference system in the ProbZelus streaming

server unavailable to legitimate clients. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a
frequent target of DDoS attacks. Since DNS is a critical infrastructure
service, protecting it from DoS is imperative. Many prior approaches have
focused on specific filters or anti-spoofing techniques to protect generic
services. DNS root nameservers are more challenging to protect, since they use
fixed IP addresses, serve very diverse clients and requests, receive
predominantly UDP traffic that can be spoofed, and must guarantee high quality
of service. In this paper we propose a layered DDoS defense for DNS root
nameservers. Our defense uses a library of defensive filters, which can be
optimized for different attack types, with different levels of selectivity. We
further propose a method that automatically and continuously evaluates and
selects the best combination of filters throughout the attack. We show that
this layered defense approach provides exceptional protection against all
attack types using traces of ten real attacks from a DNS root nameserver. Our
automated system can select the best defense within seconds and quickly reduces
traffic to the server within a manageable range, while keeping collateral
damage lower than 2%. We can handle millions of filtering rules without
noticeable operational overhead.

technique to generate image sequences of the flow of a contrast material inside
tissues and organs. However, its application to imaging bolus movement through
the esophagus has only been demonstrated in few feasibility studies and is
relatively unexplored. In this work, we present a computational framework
called mechanics-informed MRI (MRI-MECH) that enhances that capability thereby
increasing the applicability of dynamic MRI for diagnosing esophageal
disorders. Pineapple juice was used as the swallowed contrast material for the
dynamic MRI and the MRI image sequence was used as input to the MRI-MECH. The
MRI-MECH modeled the esophagus as a flexible one-dimensional tube and the
elastic tube walls followed a linear tube law. Flow through the esophagus was
then governed by one-dimensional mass and momentum conservation equations.
These equations were solved using a physics-informed neural network (PINN). The
PINN minimized the difference between the measurements from the MRI and model
predictions ensuring that the physics of the fluid flow problem was always
followed. MRI-MECH calculated the fluid velocity and pressure during esophageal
transit and estimated the mechanical health of the esophagus by calculating
wall stiffness and active relaxation. Additionally, MRI-MECH predicted missing
information about the lower esophageal sphincter during the emptying process,
demonstrating its applicability to scenarios with missing data or poor image
resolution. In addition to potentially improving clinical decisions based on
quantitative estimates of the mechanical health of the esophagus, MRI-MECH can
also be enhanced for application to other medical imaging modalities to enhance

method is to mask out a proportion of the edges, and a GNN is trained to

That is, the masked graph inputted to the GNN deviates from the original graph.
To alleviate this issue, we propose DiP-GNN (Discriminative Pre-training of

identities of the masked edges, and simultaneously, we train a discriminator to
distinguish the generated edges from the original graph's edges. In our
framework, the graph seen by the discriminator better matches the original

natural systems are heterogeneous: few elements are more relevant, larger,

balance between change and stability, order and chaos -- is usually found for a
very narrow region in the parameter space, close to a phase transition. Using
random Boolean networks -- a general model of discrete dynamical systems -- we
show that heterogeneity -- in time, structure, and function -- can broaden
additively the parameter region where criticality is found. Moreover, parameter
regions where antifragility is found are also increased with heterogeneity.
However, maximum antifragility is found for particular parameters in

objective function by only leveraging a static dataset of designs and their
scores. This problem setting arises in numerous fields including the design of
materials, robots, DNA sequences, and proteins. Recent approaches train a deep
neural network (DNN) on the static dataset to act as a proxy function, and then
perform gradient ascent on the existing designs to obtain potentially
high-scoring designs. This methodology frequently suffers from the
out-of-distribution problem where the proxy function often returns poor
designs. To mitigate this problem, we propose BiDirectional learning for
offline Infinite-width model-based optimization (BDI). BDI consists of two
mappings: the forward mapping leverages the static dataset to predict the
scores of the high-scoring designs, and the backward mapping leverages the
high-scoring designs to predict the scores of the static dataset. The backward
mapping, neglected in previous work, can distill more information from the
static dataset into the high-scoring designs, which effectively mitigates the
out-of-distribution problem. For a finite-width DNN model, the loss function of
the backward mapping is intractable and only has an approximate form, which
leads to a significant deterioration of the design quality. We thus adopt an
infinite-width DNN model, and propose to employ the corresponding neural
tangent kernel to yield a closed-form loss for more accurate design updates.
Experiments on various tasks verify the effectiveness of BDI. The code is

despite different initialisations, the solutions found by SGD lie in the same
loss valley after taking into account the permutation invariance of neural
networks. Concretely, they hypothesise that any two solutions found by SGD can
be permuted such that the linear interpolation between their parameters forms a
path without significant increases in loss. Here, we use a simple but powerful
algorithm to find such permutations that allows us to obtain direct empirical
evidence that the hypothesis is true in fully connected networks. Strikingly,
we find that two networks already live in the same loss valley at the time of
initialisation and averaging their random, but suitably permuted initialisation
performs significantly above chance. In contrast, for convolutional
architectures, our evidence suggests that the hypothesis does not hold.

zero-shot generalization in many downstream tasks with properly designed text

training on domain-specific data reduces a model's generalization capability to
unseen new domains. In this work, we propose test-time prompt tuning (TPT), a
method that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample.
For image classification, TPT optimizes the prompt by minimizing the entropy
with confidence selection so that the model has consistent predictions across
different augmented views of each test sample. In evaluating generalization to
natural distribution shifts, TPT improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP
by 3.6% on average, surpassing previous prompt tuning approaches that require

generation use pairwise comparisons between a single generated text and the
best-matching gold-standard ground truth text. When multiple ground truths are
available, scores are aggregated using an average or max operation across
references. While this approach works well when diversity in the ground truth
data (i.e. dispersion of the distribution of conditional texts) can be ascribed
to noise, such as in automated speech recognition, it does not allow for robust
evaluation in the case where diversity in the ground truths represents signal
for the model. In this work we argue that existing metrics are not appropriate
for domains such as visual description or summarization where ground truths are
semantically diverse, and where the diversity in those captions captures useful
additional information about the context. We propose a novel paradigm for
multi-candidate evaluation of conditional language generation models, and a new
family of metrics that compare the distributions of reference and
model-generated caption sets using small sample sets of each. We demonstrate
the utility of our approach with a case study in visual description: where we
show that existing models optimize for single-description quality over
diversity, and gain some insights into how sampling methods and temperature
impact description quality and diversity.

sub-terahertz communication systems, especially in scenarios with highly-mobile
users. Leveraging external sensing modalities such as vision, LiDAR, radar,
position, or a combination of them, to address this beam management challenge
has recently attracted increasing interest from both academia and industry.
This is mainly motivated by the dependency of the beam direction decision on
the user location and the geometry of the surrounding environment --
information that can be acquired from the sensory data. To realize the promised
beam management gains, such as the significant reduction in beam alignment
overhead, in practice, however, these solutions need to account for important
aspects. For example, these multi-modal sensing aided beam selection approaches
should be able to generalize their learning to unseen scenarios and should be
able to operate in realistic dense deployments.
  The ""Multi-Modal Beam Prediction Challenge 2022: Towards Generalization""
competition is offered to provide a platform for investigating these critical
questions. In order to facilitate the generalizability study, the competition
offers a large-scale multi-modal dataset with co-existing communication and
sensing data collected across multiple real-world locations and different times

matching polytope of graphs, in the random-order (RCRS) and adversarial (OCRS)
arrival models. Our results include improved selectability guarantees (i.e.,
lower bounds), as well as new impossibility results (i.e., upper bounds). By
well-known reductions to the prophet (secretary) matching problem, a
$c$-selectable OCRS (RCRS) implies a $c$-competitive algorithm for adversarial
(random order) edge arrivals. Similar reductions are also known for the
query-commit matching problem. For the adversarial arrival model, we present a
new analysis of the OCRS of Ezra et al.~(EC, 2020). We show that this scheme is
$0.344$-selectable for general graphs and $0.349$-selectable for bipartite
graphs, improving on the previous $0.337$ selectability result for this
algorithm. We also show that the selectability of this scheme cannot be greater
than $0.361$ for general graphs and $0.382$ for bipartite graphs. We further
show that no OCRS can achieve a selectability greater than $0.4$ for general
graphs, and $0.433$ for bipartite graphs.
  For random-order arrivals, we present two attenuation-based schemes which use
new attenuation functions. Our first RCRS is $0.474$-selectable for general
graphs, and our second is $0.476$-selectable for bipartite graphs. These
results improve upon the recent $0.45$ (and $0.456$) selectability results for
general graphs (respectively, bipartite graphs) due to Pollner et al.~(EC,
2022). On general graphs, our 0.474-selectable RCRS provides the best known
positive result even for offline contention resolution, and also for the
correlation gap. We conclude by proving a fundamental upper bound of 0.5 on the
selectability of RCRS, using bipartite graphs.

networks, a problem that is critical to on-device machine learning applications
but has been overlooked in the literature where research has been focused on
large models only. Tiny neural networks have much fewer parameters and lower
complexity, and thus should not be trained the same way as their large
counterparts for DG applications. We find that knowledge distillation is a
strong candidate for solving the problem: it outperforms state-of-the-art DG
methods that were developed using large models with a large margin. Moreover,
we observe that the teacher-student performance gap on test data with domain
shift is bigger than that on in-distribution data. To improve DG for tiny
neural networks without increasing the deployment cost, we propose a simple
idea called out-of-distribution knowledge distillation (OKD), which aims to
teach the student how the teacher handles (synthetic) out-of-distribution data

in computer science and combinatorial optimization. Tree edit distance is a
natural generalization of edit distance in which the task is to compute a
measure of dissimilarity between two (unweighted) rooted trees with node
labels. Perhaps the most notable recent application of tree edit distance is in
NoSQL big databases, such as MongoDB, where each row of the database is a JSON
document represented as a labeled rooted tree, and finding dissimilarity
between two rows is a basic operation. Until recently, the fastest algorithm
for tree edit distance ran in cubic time (Demaine, Mozes, Rossman, Weimann;
TALG'10); however, Mao (FOCS'21) broke the cubic barrier for the tree edit
distance problem using fast matrix multiplication.
  Given a parameter $k$ as an upper bound on the distance, an $O(n+k^2)$-time
algorithm for edit distance has been known since the 1980s due to the works of
Myers (Algorithmica'86) and Landau and Vishkin (JCSS'88). The existence of an
$\tilde{O}(n+\mathrm{poly}(k))$-time algorithm for tree edit distance has been
posed as an open question, e.g., by Akmal and Jin (ICALP'21), who gave a
state-of-the-art $\tilde{O}(nk^2)$-time algorithm. In this paper, we answer
this question positively.

pretraining. We demonstrate, for the first time, such a paradigm benefits both
image and video tasks, as opposed to the conventional one-directional transfer
(e.g., use image-language to help video-language). To this end, we propose a
decoupled joint pretraining of image-language and video-language to effectively
decompose the vision-language modeling into spatial and temporal dimensions and
obtain performance boost on both image and video tasks. Moreover, we introduce
a novel unified vision-language contrastive (UniVLC) loss to leverage
image-text, video-text, image-label (e.g., image classification), video-label
(e.g., video action recognition) data together, so that both supervised and
noisily supervised pretraining data are utilized as much as possible. Without
incurring extra task-specific adaptors, OmniVL can simultaneously support
visual only tasks (e.g., image classification, video action recognition),
cross-modal alignment tasks (e.g., image/video-text retrieval), and multi-modal
understanding and generation tasks (e.g., image/video question answering,

yet they introduce severe disparity of accuracy and robustness between
different classes, known as the robust fairness problem. Previously proposed
Fair Robust Learning (FRL) adaptively reweights different classes to improve
fairness. However, the performance of the better-performed classes decreases,
leading to a strong performance drop. In this paper, we observed two unfair
phenomena during adversarial training: different difficulties in generating
adversarial examples from each class (source-class fairness) and disparate
target class tendencies when generating adversarial examples (target-class
fairness). From the observations, we propose Balance Adversarial Training (BAT)
to address the robust fairness problem. Regarding source-class fairness, we
adjust the attack strength and difficulties of each class to generate samples
near the decision boundary for easier and fairer model learning; considering
target-class fairness, by introducing a uniform distribution constraint, we
encourage the adversarial example generation process for each class with a fair
tendency. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10,

characterization, such as peak and luminosity decline estimation. However, the
collected time series are multidimensional, irregularly sampled, contain
outliers, and do not have well-defined systematic uncertainties. Machine
learning methods help extract useful information from available data in the
most efficient way. We consider several light curve approximation methods based
on neural networks: Multilayer Perceptrons, Bayesian Neural Networks, and

data with pixel-wise annotations. However, to learn high-fidelity image-mask
synthesis, existing GAN approaches first need a pre-training phase requiring
large amounts of image data, which limits their utilization in restricted image
domains. In this work, we take a step to reduce this limitation, introducing
the task of one-shot image-mask synthesis. We aim to generate diverse images
and their segmentation masks given only a single labelled example, and
assuming, contrary to previous models, no access to any pre-training data. To
this end, inspired by the recent architectural developments of single-image
GANs, we introduce our OSMIS model which enables the synthesis of segmentation
masks that are precisely aligned to the generated images in the one-shot
regime. Besides achieving the high fidelity of generated masks, OSMIS
outperforms state-of-the-art single-image GAN models in image synthesis quality
and diversity. In addition, despite not using any additional data, OSMIS
demonstrates an impressive ability to serve as a source of useful data
augmentation for one-shot segmentation applications, providing performance
gains that are complementary to standard data augmentation techniques. Code is

covering from exascale scientific simulation to large-scale data analytics.
Offloading linear algebra kernels on one GPU will no longer be viable in these
applications, simply because the rapidly growing data volume may exceed the
memory capacity and computing power of a single GPU. Multi-GPU systems nowadays
being ubiquitous in supercomputers and data-centers present great potentials in
scaling up large sparse linear algebra kernels. In this work, we design a novel
sparse matrix representation framework for multi-GPU systems called MSREP, to
scale sparse linear algebra operations based on our augmented sparse matrix
formats in a balanced pattern. Different from dense operations, sparsity
significantly intensifies the difficulty of distributing the computation
workload among multiple GPUs in a balanced manner. We enhance three mainstream
sparse data formats -- CSR, CSC, and COO, to enable fine-grained data
distribution. We take sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) as an example
to demonstrate the efficiency of our MSREP framework. In addition, MSREP can be

We assume that the edges have the same length, and that traveling along an edge
takes a unit of time. Two objective functions are considered: the cover time
and the cover length. The cover time is the maximum time a robot needs to
finish its assigned walk and the cover length is the sum of the lengths of all
the walks. We also consider a variant in which the robots must rendezvous
periodically at the same vertex in at most a certain number of moves. We show
that the problem is different for the two cost functions. For the cover time
minimization problem, we prove that the problem is NP-hard when $k$ is part of
the input, regardless of whether periodic rendezvous are required or not. For
the cover length minimization problem, we show that it can be solved in
polynomial time when periodic rendezvous are not required, and it is NP-hard
otherwise.

potentially large-scale port-Hamiltonian (pH) plants. Our method computes
controllers that are also pH (and thus passive) such that the resulting
closed-loop systems is again passive, which ensures closed-loop stability
simply from the structure of the plant and controller matrices. In this way, we
can avoid computationally expensive eigenvalue computations that would
otherwise be necessary. In combination with a sample-based objective function
which allows us to avoid multiple evaluations of the H-infinity norm (which is
typically the main computational burden in fixed-order H-infinity controller
synthesis), this makes our method well-suited for plants with a high
state-space dimension.
  In our numerical experiments, we show that applying a passivity-enforcing
post-processing step after using well-established H-infinity synthesis methods
often leads to a deteriorated H-infinity performance. In constrast to that, our
method computes pH controllers, that are automatically passive and
simultaneously aim to minimize the H-infinity norm of the closed-loop transfer
function. Moreover, our experiments show that for large-scale plants, our
method is significantly faster than the well-established fixed-order H-infinity
controller synthesis methods.

that the time-dependent portion in the dynamical threshold is essential to
derive the lower bound of the times between two consecutive control updates. As

many species. The butterfly species is one of the prominent and a bit
insightful in their random flights and converting that into an artificial
metaphor would lead to enormous possibilities. This paper considers one such
metaphor known as Butterfly Mating Optimization (BMO). In BMO, the Bfly follows
the patrolling mating phenomena and simultaneously captures all the local
optima of multimodal functions. To imitate this algorithm, a mobile robot
(Bflybot) was designed to meet the features of the Bfly in the BMO algorithm.
Also, the multi-Bflybot swarm is designed to act like butterflies in nature and
follow the algorithm's rules. The real-time experiments were performed on the
BMO algorithm in the multi-robotic arena and considered the signal source as
the light source. The experimental results show that the BMO algorithm is
applicable to detect multiple signal sources with significant variations in
their movements i.e., static and dynamic. In the case of static signal sources,
with varying initial locations of Bflybots, the convergence is affected in
terms of time and smoothness. Whereas the experiments with varying step-size
leads to their variation in the execution time and speed of the bots. In this

  E-commerce Websites",,,,,cs.IR cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  E-commerce queries are often short and ambiguous. Consequently, query
understanding often uses query rewriting to disambiguate user-input queries.
While using e-commerce search tools, users tend to enter multiple searches,
which we call context, before purchasing. These history searches contain
contextual insights about users' true shopping intents. Therefore, modeling
such contextual information is critical to a better query rewriting model.
However, existing query rewriting models ignore users' history behaviors and
consider only the instant search query, which is often a short string offering
limited information about the true shopping intent.
  We propose an end-to-end context-aware query rewriting model to bridge this
gap, which takes the search context into account. Specifically, our model
builds a session graph using the history search queries and their contained
words. We then employ a graph attention mechanism that models cross-query
relations and computes contextual information of the session. The model
subsequently calculates session representations by combining the contextual
information with the instant search query using an aggregation network. The
session representations are then decoded to generate rewritten queries.
Empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of our method to state-of-the-art
approaches under various metrics. On in-house data from an online shopping
platform, by introducing contextual information, our model achieves 11.6%
improvement under the MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) metric and 20.1% improvement

baseline method (Transformer-based model).

activations. Deep networks suffer from notoriously increased training
complexity, mandating careful initialization of weights, requiring lower
learning rates, etc. These issues have been addressed by Batch Normalization
(\textbf{BN}), by normalizing the inputs of activations to zero mean and unit
standard deviation. Making this batch normalization part of the training
process dramatically accelerates the training process of very deep networks. A
new field of research has been going on to examine the exact theoretical
explanation behind the success of \textbf{BN}. Most of these theoretical
insights attempt to explain the benefits of \textbf{BN} by placing them on its
influence on optimization, weight scale invariance, and regularization. Despite
\textbf{BN} undeniable success in accelerating generalization, the gap of
analytically relating the effect of \textbf{BN} to the regularization parameter
is still missing. This paper aims to bring out the data-dependent auto-tuning

robustness of deep neural networks separately. In practice, however, models
need to enjoy both types of robustness to ensure reliability. In this work, we
bridge this gap and show that in fact, explicit tradeoffs exist between
adversarial and natural distributional robustness. We first consider a simple
linear regression setting on Gaussian data with disjoint sets of core and
spurious features. In this setting, through theoretical and empirical analysis,
we show that (i) adversarial training with $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms
increases the model reliance on spurious features; (ii) For $\ell_\infty$
adversarial training, spurious reliance only occurs when the scale of the
spurious features is larger than that of the core features; (iii) adversarial
training can have an unintended consequence in reducing distributional
robustness, specifically when spurious correlations are changed in the new test
domain. Next, we present extensive empirical evidence, using a test suite of
twenty adversarially trained models evaluated on five benchmark datasets
(ObjectNet, RIVAL10, Salient ImageNet-1M, ImageNet-9, Waterbirds), that
adversarially trained classifiers rely on backgrounds more than their
standardly trained counterparts, validating our theoretical results. We also
show that spurious correlations in training data (when preserved in the test
domain) can improve adversarial robustness, revealing that previous claims that

joints 3D positions over time with respect to a fixed hip joint. We propose to
make the two predictions simultaneously, as the shared representation can
improve the model performance. Therefore, the model consists of two sets of
encoders and decoders. First, a multi-head attention module applied to encoder
outputs improves human trajectory. Second, another multi-head self-attention
module applied to encoder outputs concatenated with decoder outputs facilitates

requires the trained models to be well-calibrated. Most current calibration
techniques address classification problems while focusing on improving
calibration on in-domain predictions. Little to no attention is paid towards
addressing calibration of visual object detectors which occupy similar space
and importance in many decision making systems. In this paper, we study the
calibration of current object detection models, particularly under domain
shift. To this end, we first introduce a plug-and-play train-time calibration
loss for object detection. It can be used as an auxiliary loss function to
improve detector's calibration. Second, we devise a new uncertainty
quantification mechanism for object detection which can implicitly calibrate
the commonly used self-training based domain adaptive detectors. We include in
our study both single-stage and two-stage object detectors. We demonstrate that
our loss improves calibration for both in-domain and out-of-domain detections
with notable margins. Finally, we show the utility of our techniques in
calibrating the domain adaptive object detectors in diverse domain shift
scenarios.

  Broadcast",,,,,cs.IT math.IT,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Linear computation broadcast (LCBC) refers to a setting with $d$ dimensional
data stored at a central server, where $K$ users, each with some prior linear
side-information, wish to retrieve various linear combinations of the data. The
goal is to determine the minimum amount of information that must be broadcast
to satisfy all the users. The reciprocal of the optimal broadcast cost is the
capacity of LCBC. The capacity is known for up to $K=3$ users. Since LCBC
includes index coding as a special case, large $K$ settings of LCBC are at
least as hard as the index coding problem. Instead of the general setting (all
instances), by focusing on the generic setting (almost all instances) this work
shows that the generic capacity of the symmetric LCBC (where every user has
$m'$ dimensions of side-information and $m$ dimensions of demand) for large
number of users ($K>d$ suffices) is $C_g=1/\Delta_g$, where
$\Delta_g=\min\left\{\max\{0,d-m'\}, Km, \frac{dm}{m+m'}\right\}$ is the
broadcast cost that is both achievable and unbeatable asymptotically almost
surely for large $n$, among all LCBC instances with the given parameters
$p,K,d,m,m'$. Relative to baseline schemes of random coding or separate
transmissions, $C_g$ shows an extremal gain by a factor of $K$ as a function of
number of users, and by a factor of $\approx d/4$ as a function of data
dimensions, when optimized over remaining parameters. For arbitrary number of
users, the generic capacity of the symmetric LCBC is characterized within a
factor of $2$.

data structured in the form of graphs or networks. To apply traditional machine
learning and data analytic techniques to such data it is necessary to transform
graphs into vector-based representations that preserve the most essential
structural properties of graphs. For this purpose, a large number of graph
embedding methods have been proposed in the literature. Most of them produce
general-purpose embeddings suitable for a variety of applications such as node
clustering, node classification, graph visualisation and link prediction. In
this paper, we propose two novel graph embedding algorithms based on random
walks that are specifically designed for the node classification problem.
Random walk sampling strategies of the proposed algorithms have been designed
to pay special attention to hubs -- high-degree nodes that have the most
critical role for the overall connectedness in large-scale graphs. The proposed
methods are experimentally evaluated by analyzing the classification
performance of three classification algorithms trained on embeddings of
real-world networks. The obtained results indicate that our methods
considerably improve the predictive power of examined classifiers compared to
currently the most popular random walk method for generating general-purpose
graph embeddings (node2vec).

classification models for edge devices. However, the performance of KD is
affected by the large capacity gap between the teacher and student networks.
Recent methods have resorted to a multiple teacher assistant (TA) setting for
KD, which sequentially decreases the size of the teacher model to relatively
bridge the size gap between these models. This paper proposes a new technique
called Curriculum Expert Selection for Knowledge Distillation (CES-KD) to
efficiently enhance the learning of a compact student under the capacity gap
problem. This technique is built upon the hypothesis that a student network
should be guided gradually using stratified teaching curriculum as it learns
easy (hard) data samples better and faster from a lower (higher) capacity
teacher network. Specifically, our method is a gradual TA-based KD technique
that selects a single teacher per input image based on a curriculum driven by
the difficulty in classifying the image. In this work, we empirically verify
our hypothesis and rigorously experiment with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10,

and AR devices. However, the power efficiency of head-mounted displays is
naturally at odds with growing computational requirements driven by better
resolution, refresh rate, and dynamic ranges, all of which reduce the sustained
usage time of untethered AR/VR devices. For instance, the Oculus Quest 2, under
a fully-charged battery, can sustain only 2 to 3 hours of operation time. Prior
display power reduction techniques mostly target smartphone displays. Directly
applying smartphone display power reduction techniques, however, degrades the
visual perception in AR/VR with noticeable artifacts. For instance, the
""power-saving mode"" on smartphones uniformly lowers the pixel luminance across
the display and, as a result, presents an overall darkened visual perception to
users if directly applied to VR content.
  Our key insight is that VR display power reduction must be cognizant of the
gaze-contingent nature of high field-of-view VR displays. To that end, we
present a gaze-contingent system that, without degrading luminance, minimizes
the display power consumption while preserving high visual fidelity when users
actively view immersive video sequences. This is enabled by constructing a
gaze-contingent color discrimination model through psychophysical studies, and
a display power model (with respect to pixel color) through real-device
measurements. Critically, due to the careful design decisions made in
constructing the two models, our algorithm is cast as a constrained
optimization problem with a closed-form solution, which can be implemented as a
real-time, image-space shader. We evaluate our system using a series of
psychophysical studies and large-scale analyses on natural images. Experiment
results show that our system reduces the display power by as much as 24% with
little to no perceptual fidelity degradation.

Better-positioned members not only benefit from (faster) access to diverse
information, but innately have more potential influence on information spread.
Structural biases often arise from network formation, and can lead to
significant disparities in information access based on position. Further,
processes such as link recommendation can exacerbate this inequality by relying
on network structure to augment connectivity.
  We argue that one can understand and quantify this social capital through the
lens of information flow in the network. We consider the setting where all
nodes may be sources of distinct information, and a node's (dis)advantage deems
its ability to access all information available on the network. We introduce
three new measures of advantage (broadcast, influence, and control), which are
quantified in terms of position in the network using \it{access signatures} --
vectors that represent a node's ability to share information. We then consider
the problem of improving equity by making interventions to increase the access
of the least-advantaged nodes. We argue that edge augmentation is most
appropriate for mitigating bias in the network structure, and frame a budgeted
intervention problem for maximizing minimum pairwise access.
  Finally, we propose heuristic strategies for selecting edge augmentations and
empirically evaluate their performance on a corpus of real-world social
networks. We demonstrate that a small number of interventions significantly
increase the broadcast measure of access for the least-advantaged nodes (over 5
times more than random), and also improve the minimum influence. Additional
analysis shows that these interventions can also dramatically shrink the gap in
advantage between nodes (over \%82) and reduce disparities between their access
signatures.

aims to maximize their own gain by anticipating and manipulating the
equilibrium state at which followers settle by playing a congestion game.
Large-scale SCGs are well known for their intractability and complexity. This
study approaches SCGs through differentiable programming, which marries the
latest developments in machine learning with conventional methodologies. The
core idea centers on representing the lower-level equilibrium problem using an
evolution path formed by the imitative logit dynamics. It enables the use of
automatic differentiation over the evolution path towards equilibrium, leading
to a double-loop gradient descent algorithm. We further show the fixation on
the lower-level equilibrium may be a self-imposed computational obstacle.
Instead, the leader may only look ahead along the followers' evolution path for
a few steps, while updating their decisions in sync with the followers through
a co-evolution process. The revelation gives rise to a single-loop algorithm
that is more efficient in terms of both memory consumption and computation
time. Through numerical experiments that cover a wide range of benchmark
problems, we find the single-loop algorithm consistently strikes a good balance
between solution quality and efficiency, outperforming not only the standard
double-loop implementation but also other methods from the literature.
Importantly, our results highlight both the wastefulness of ""full anticipation""
and the peril of ""zero anticipation"". If a quick-and-dirty heuristic is needed
for solving a really large SCG, the proposed single-loop algorithm with a
one-step look-ahead makes an ideal candidate.

inspired by the hierarchical off-diagonal low rank format, where elements are
recursively partitioned using a quadtree or octree and blocks are compressed
using a sparse singular value decomposition -- the hierarchical matrix is
assembled using dynamic programming. The motivating application is
time-dependent thermal modeling on vast planetary surfaces, with a focus on
permanently shadowed craters which receive energy through indirect irradiance.
In this setting, shape models are comprised of a large number of triangular
facets which conform to a rough surface. At each time step, a quadratic number
of triangle-to-triangle scattered fluxes must be summed; that is, as the sun
moves through the sky, we must solve the same view factor system of equations
for a potentially unlimited number of time-varying righthand sides. We first
conduct numerical experiments with a synthetic spherical cap-shaped crater,
where the equilibrium temperature is analytically available. We also test our
implementation with triangle meshes of planetary surfaces derived from digital
elevation models recovered by orbiting spacecrafts. Our results indicate that
the compressed view factor matrix can be assembled in quadratic time, which is
comparable to the time it takes to assemble the full view matrix itself. Memory
requirements during assembly are reduced by a large factor. Finally, for a
range of compression tolerances, the size of the compressed view factor matrix
and the speed of the resulting matrix vector product both scale linearly (as
opposed to quadratically for the full matrix), resulting in orders of magnitude

follower best responds, has found widespread application, particularly to
security problems. In the security setting, the goal is for the leader to
compute an optimal strategy to commit to, in order to protect some asset. In
many of these applications, the parameters of the follower utility model are
not known with certainty. Distributionally-robust optimization addresses this
issue by allowing a distribution over possible model parameters, where this
distribution comes from a set of possible distributions. The goal is to
maximize the expected utility with respect to the worst-case distribution. We
initiate the study of distributionally-robust models for computing the optimal
strategy to commit to. We consider the case of normal-form games with
uncertainty about the follower utility model. Our main theoretical result is to
show that a distributionally-robust Stackelberg equilibrium always exists
across a wide array of uncertainty models. For the case of a finite set of
possible follower utility functions we present two algorithms to compute a
distributionally-robust strong Stackelberg equilibrium (DRSSE) using
mathematical programs. Next, in the general case where there is an infinite
number of possible follower utility functions and the uncertainty is
represented by a Wasserstein ball around a finitely-supported nominal
distribution, we give an incremental mixed-integer-programming-based algorithm
for computing the optimal distributionally-robust strategy. Experiments
substantiate the tractability of our algorithm on a classical Stackelberg game,
showing that our approach scales to medium-sized games.

adaptation to efficiently leverage air-to-ground channel stochastics, we first
derive the optimal control policy for a single relay via a semi-Markov decision
process formulation, with competitive swarm optimization for UAV trajectory
design. Accordingly, we detail a multiscale decomposition of this construction:
outer decisions on radial wait velocities and end positions optimize the
expected long-term delay-power trade-off; consequently, inner decisions on
angular wait velocities, service schedules, and UAV trajectories greedily
minimize the instantaneous delay-power costs. Next, generalizing to UAV swarms

eye-movements. For the EyeLink family of eye-trackers, these two filters are

only, this will allow users to collect unfiltered data and simultaneously have
access to unfiltered, STD filtered and EXTRA filtered data for the exact same
recording. Based on the literature, which has employed various eye-tracking
technologies, and our analysis of our EyeLink-1000 data, we conclude that the
highest signal frequency content needed for most eye-tracking studies (i.e.,
saccades, microsaccades and smooth pursuit) is around 100 Hz, excluding
fixation microtremor. For those who collect their data at 1000 Hz or higher, we

filtered by low-pass digital filters. We also examine the frequency response of

of a feature map and thereby reduce inference compute and memory footprint for
resource-constrained computer vision applications have recently gained
significant traction. However, prior pooling works extract only the local
context of the activation maps, limiting their effectiveness. In contrast, we
propose a novel non-local self-attentive pooling method that can be used as a
drop-in replacement to the standard pooling layers, such as max/average pooling
or strided convolution. The proposed self-attention module uses patch
embedding, multi-head self-attention, and spatial-channel restoration, followed
by sigmoid activation and exponential soft-max. This self-attention mechanism
efficiently aggregates dependencies between non-local activation patches during
down-sampling. Extensive experiments on standard object classification and
detection tasks with various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed mechanism over the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) pooling techniques. In particular, we surpass the test accuracy of
existing pooling techniques on different variants of MobileNet-V2 on ImageNet
by an average of 1.2%. With the aggressive down-sampling of the activation maps
in the initial layers (providing up to 22x reduction in memory consumption),
our approach achieves 1.43% higher test accuracy compared to SOTA techniques
with iso-memory footprints. This enables the deployment of our models in
memory-constrained devices, such as micro-controllers (without losing
significant accuracy), because the initial activation maps consume a
significant amount of on-chip memory for high-resolution images required for
complex vision tasks. Our proposed pooling method also leverages the idea of
channel pruning to further reduce memory footprints.

However, the complexity might grow exponentially for the simplest nonlinear
models, where global convergence is impossible within finite iterations. When
the model suffers a large generalization error, which is quantitatively
measured by the model complexity, the uncertainty can be large. The sampled
model that current policy is greedily optimized upon will thus be unsettled,
resulting in aggressive policy updates and over-exploration. In this work, we
propose Conservative Dual Policy Optimization (CDPO) that involves a
Referential Update and a Conservative Update. The policy is first optimized
under a reference model, which imitates the mechanism of PSRL while offering
more stability. A conservative range of randomness is guaranteed by maximizing
the expectation of model value. Without harmful sampling procedures, CDPO can
still achieve the same regret as PSRL. More importantly, CDPO enjoys monotonic

build a Chinese corpus for Contextualized Figure Recognition (ConFiguRe).
Different from previous token-level or sentence-level counterparts, ConFiguRe
aims at extracting a figurative unit from discourse-level context, and
classifying the figurative unit into the right figure type. On ConFiguRe, three
tasks, i.e., figure extraction, figure type classification and figure
recognition, are designed and the state-of-the-art techniques are utilized to
implement the benchmarks. We conduct thorough experiments and show that all
three tasks are challenging for existing models, thus requiring further
research. Our dataset and code are publicly available at

interest for molecular simulations. We propose a general stochastic method for
learning pair interactions from data using differentiable simulations
(DiffSim). DiffSim defines a loss function based on structural observables,
such as the radial distribution function, through molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. The interaction potentials are then learned directly by stochastic
gradient descent, using backpropagation to calculate the gradient of the
structural loss metric with respect to the interaction potential through the MD
simulation. This gradient-based method is flexible and can be configured to
simulate and optimize multiple systems simultaneously. For example, it is
possible to simultaneously learn potentials for different temperatures or for
different compositions. We demonstrate the approach by recovering simple pair
potentials, such as Lennard-Jones systems, from radial distribution functions.
We find that DiffSim can be used to probe a wider functional space of pair
potentials compared to traditional methods like Iterative Boltzmann Inversion.
We show that our methods can be used to simultaneously fit potentials for
simulations at different compositions and temperatures to improve the
transferability of the learned potentials.

make sense of the world. However, such abundance may not always lead to good
performance when it comes to learning sensorimotor control policies from human
demonstrations.
  Extraneous data modalities can lead to state over-specification, where the
state contains modalities that are not only useless for decision-making but
also can change data distribution across environments. State over-specification
leads to issues such as the learned policy not generalizing outside of the
training data distribution.
  In this work, we propose Masked Imitation Learning (MIL) to address state
over-specification by selectively using informative modalities. Specifically,
we design a masked policy network with a binary mask to block certain
modalities. We develop a bi-level optimization algorithm that learns this mask
to accurately filter over-specified modalities. We demonstrate empirically that
MIL outperforms baseline algorithms in simulated domains including MuJoCo and a
robot arm environment using the Robomimic dataset, and effectively recovers the
environment-invariant modalities on a multimodal dataset collected on a real
robot. Our project website presents supplemental details and videos of our

vegetable salad owing to its high nutrition, freshness, and convenience.
However, enzymatic browning discoloration on lettuce cut edges significantly
reduces product quality and shelf life. While there are many research and
breeding efforts underway to minimize browning, the progress is hindered by the
lack of a rapid and reliable methodology to evaluate browning. Current methods
to identify and quantify browning are either too subjective, labor intensive,
or inaccurate. In this paper, we report a deep learning model for lettuce
browning prediction. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first-of-its-kind
on deep learning for lettuce browning prediction using a pretrained Siamese
Quadratic Swin (SQ-Swin) transformer with several highlights. First, our model
includes quadratic features in the transformer model which is more powerful to
incorporate real-world representations than the linear transformer. Second, a
multi-scale training strategy is proposed to augment the data and explore more
of the inherent self-similarity of the lettuce images. Third, the proposed
model uses a siamese architecture which learns the inter-relations among the
limited training samples. Fourth, the model is pretrained on the ImageNet and
then trained with the reptile meta-learning algorithm to learn higher-order

decade, we witnessed dramatic gains in natural language processing and

the capability of few-shot prompting techniques such as chain of thought to
emulate human reasoning in large language models. This hallmark feature of
few-shot prompting, combined with ever scaling language models, opened a vista
of possibilities to solve various tasks, such as math word problems, code
completion, and commonsense reasoning. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting further
pushes the performance of models in a few-shot setup, by supplying intermediate
steps and urging the model to follow the same process. Despite its compelling
performance, the genesis of reasoning capability in these models is less
explored. This work initiates the preliminary steps towards a deeper
understanding of reasoning mechanisms in large language models. Our work
centers around querying the model while controlling for all but one of the
components in a prompt: symbols, patterns, and text. We then analyze the
performance divergence across the queries. Our results suggest the presence of
factual patterns in a prompt is not necessary for the success of CoT.
Nonetheless, we empirically show that relying solely on patterns is also
insufficient for high quality results. We posit that text imbues patterns with
commonsense knowledge and meaning. Our exhaustive empirical analysis provides
qualitative examples of the symbiotic relationship between text and patterns.
Such systematic understanding of CoT enables us to devise concise chain of
thought, dubbed as CCoT, where text and patterns are pruned to only retain
their key roles, while delivering on par or slightly higher solve task rate.

little time. The second stage can further calibrate the extrinsic parameters
based on LiDAR-mapping space occupancy while removing motion distortion. In the
final stage, the z-axis errors caused by the plane motion of the autonomous
vehicle are corrected, and an accurate extrinsic parameter is finally obtained.

insufficient alignment. Thus, many UDA works attempt to vanish the domain gap
gradually and softly via various intermediate spaces, dubbed domain bridging
(DB). However, for dense prediction tasks such as domain adaptive semantic
segmentation (DASS), existing solutions have mostly relied on rough style
transfer and how to elegantly bridge domains is still under-explored. In this
work, we resort to data mixing to establish a deliberated domain bridging (DDB)
for DASS, through which the joint distributions of source and target domains
are aligned and interacted with each in the intermediate space. At the heart of
DDB lies a dual-path domain bridging step for generating two intermediate
domains using the coarse-wise and the fine-wise data mixing techniques,
alongside a cross-path knowledge distillation step for taking two complementary
models trained on generated intermediate samples as 'teachers' to develop a
superior 'student' in a multi-teacher distillation manner. These two
optimization steps work in an alternating way and reinforce each other to give
rise to DDB with strong adaptation power. Extensive experiments on adaptive

represented and optimized is a fundamental problem. The root challenge in this
problem is the large scale and the high complexity of policy space, which
exacerbates the difficulty of policy learning especially in real-world
scenarios. Towards a desirable surrogate policy space, recently policy
representation in a low-dimensional latent space has shown its potential in
improving both the evaluation and optimization of policy. The key question
involved in these studies is by what criterion we should abstract the policy
space for desired compression and generalization. However, both the theory on
policy abstraction and the methodology on policy representation learning are
less studied in the literature. In this work, we make very first efforts to
fill up the vacancy. First, we propose a unified policy abstraction theory,
containing three types of policy abstraction associated to policy features at
different levels. Then, we generalize them to three policy metrics that
quantify the distance (i.e., similarity) of policies, for more convenient use
in learning policy representation. Further, we propose a policy representation
learning approach based on deep metric learning. For the empirical study, we
investigate the efficacy of the proposed policy metrics and representations, in
characterizing policy difference and conveying policy generalization
respectively. Our experiments are conducted in both policy optimization and
evaluation problems, containing trust-region policy optimization (TRPO),
diversity-guided evolution strategy (DGES) and off-policy evaluation (OPE).
Somewhat naturally, the experimental results indicate that there is no a
universally optimal abstraction for all downstream learning problems; while the
influence-irrelevance policy abstraction can be a generally preferred choice.

proposed with various manually designed augmentation techniques, aiming to
implement challenging augmentations on the original graph to yield robust
representation. Although many of them achieve remarkable performances, existing
GCL methods still struggle to improve model robustness without risking losing
task-relevant information because they ignore the fact the augmentation-induced
latent factors could be highly entangled with the original graph, thus it is
more difficult to discriminate the task-relevant information from irrelevant
information. Consequently, the learned representation is either brittle or
unilluminating. In light of this, we introduce the Adversarial Cross-View
Disentangled Graph Contrastive Learning (ACDGCL), which follows the information
bottleneck principle to learn minimal yet sufficient representations from graph
data. To be specific, our proposed model elicits the augmentation-invariant and
augmentation-dependent factors separately. Except for the conventional
contrastive loss which guarantees the consistency and sufficiency of the
representations across different contrastive views, we introduce a cross-view
reconstruction mechanism to pursue the representation disentanglement. Besides,
an adversarial view is added as the third view of contrastive loss to enhance

structure is designed to simplify the complexity of stacked separable
convolutions, and a dynamic receptive field (DRF) mechanism is developed to
maintain high accuracy by customizing the convolution kernel and its perception
range dynamically when reducing the network complexity. The CSA-DRF component
optimizes efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Then, a diagonal support

the grid ratio, where a novel technique and an improved induction argument are
proposed to overcome the difficulty posed by the unavailability of a priori
$L^\infty$ estimates of numerical solutions. Based on the integrating factor
Runge-Kutta methods, we extend the proposed scheme to arbitrarily high order,
which is also linear and conservative. Numerical experiments are presented to
confirm the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed

knowledge and fine-tuning it for future tasks. When presented with a similar
goal, neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting if data distributions
across sequential tasks are not stationary over the course of learning. An
effective approach to address such continual learning (CL) problems is to use
hypernetworks which generate task dependent weights for a target network.
However, the continual learning performance of existing hypernetwork based
approaches are affected by the assumption of independence of the weights across
the layers in order to maintain parameter efficiency. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel approach that uses a dependency preserving
hypernetwork to generate weights for the target network while also maintaining
the parameter efficiency. We propose to use recurrent neural network (RNN)
based hypernetwork that can generate layer weights efficiently while allowing
for dependencies across them. In addition, we propose novel regularisation and
network growth techniques for the RNN based hypernetwork to further improve the
continual learning performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed methods, we conducted experiments on several image classification
continual learning tasks and settings. We found that the proposed methods based
on the RNN hypernetworks outperformed the baselines in all these CL settings

with local sensitivity of functions, instead of their global sensitivity. This
framework is typically used for releasing robust statistics such as median or
trimmed mean in a differentially private manner. While PTR is a common
framework introduced over a decade ago, using it in applications such as robust
SGD where we need many adaptive robust queries is challenging. This is mainly
due to the lack of Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP) analysis, an essential
ingredient underlying the moments accountant approach for differentially
private deep learning. In this work, we generalize the standard PTR and derive
the first RDP bound for it when the target function has bounded global
sensitivity. We show that our RDP bound for PTR yields tighter DP guarantees
than the directly analyzed $(\eps, \delta)$-DP. We also derive the
algorithm-specific privacy amplification bound of PTR under subsampling. We
show that our bound is much tighter than the general upper bound and close to
the lower bound. Our RDP bounds enable tighter privacy loss calculation for the
composition of many adaptive runs of PTR. As an application of our analysis, we
show that PTR and our theoretical results can be used to design differentially
private variants for byzantine robust training algorithms that use robust

cut sparsifier of an unweighted undirected graph by taking a near-linear number
of linear measurements on the graph. Subsequent works also studied computing
other graph sparsifiers using linear sketching, and obtained near-linear upper
bounds for spectral sparsifiers [Kapralov-Lee-Musco-Musco-Sidford, FOCS'14] and
first non-trivial upper bounds for spanners [Filtser-Kapralov-Nouri, SODA'21].
All these linear sketching algorithms, however, only work on unweighted graphs.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of weighted graph sparsification by
linear sketching by investigating a natural class of linear sketches that we
call incidence sketches, in which each measurement is a linear combination of
the weights of edges incident on a single vertex. Our results are:
  1. Weighted cut sparsification: We give an algorithm that computes a $(1 +
\epsilon)$-cut sparsifier using $\tilde{O}(n \epsilon^{-3})$ linear
measurements, which is nearly optimal.
  2. Weighted spectral sparsification: We give an algorithm that computes a $(1

linear measurements. Complementing our algorithm, we then prove a superlinear
lower bound of $\Omega(n^{21/20-o(1)})$ measurements for computing some
$O(1)$-spectral sparsifier using incidence sketches.

demand for high-definition maps (HD maps) that provide reliable and robust
prior information of static surroundings in autonomous driving scenarios. As

critical for downstream tasks, such as prediction and planning. Manually
annotating lane centerline HD maps by human annotators is labor-intensive,
expensive and inefficient, severely restricting the wide application and fast
deployment of autonomous driving systems. Previous works seldom explore the
centerline HD map mapping problem due to the complicated topology and severe
overlapping issues of road centerlines. In this paper, we propose a novel
method named CenterLineDet to create the lane centerline HD map automatically.
CenterLineDet is trained by imitation learning and can effectively detect the
graph of lane centerlines by iterations with vehicle-mounted sensors. Due to
the application of the DETR-like transformer network, CenterLineDet can handle
complicated graph topology, such as lane intersections. The proposed approach
is evaluated on a large publicly available dataset Nuscenes, and the
superiority of CenterLineDet is well demonstrated by the comparison results.

unbalanced resource production of intermittent wind and photovoltaic (PV) power
is a critical issue for peer-to-peer (P2P) power trading. To resolve this

For RL, graph convolutional network (GCN) and bi-directional long short-term
memory (Bi-LSTM) network are jointly applied to P2P power trading between
nanogrid clusters based on cooperative game theory. The flexible and reliable
DC nanogrid is suitable to integrate renewable energy for distribution system.
Each local nanogrid cluster takes the position of prosumer, focusing on power
production and consumption simultaneously. For the power management of nanogrid
clusters, multi-objective optimization is applied to each local nanogrid
cluster with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Charging/discharging of
electric vehicle (EV) is performed considering the intermittent characteristics
of wind and PV power production. RL algorithms, such as deep Q-learning network
(DQN), deep recurrent Q-learning network (DRQN), Bi-DRQN, proximal policy
optimization (PPO), GCN-DQN, GCN-DRQN, GCN-Bi-DRQN, and GCN-PPO, are used for
simulations. Consequently, the cooperative P2P power trading system maximizes
the profit utilizing the time of use (ToU) tariff-based electricity cost and
system marginal price (SMP), and minimizes the amount of grid power
consumption. Power management of nanogrid clusters with P2P power trading is
simulated on the distribution test feeder in real-time and proposed GCN-PPO

  Systems - RecSys 2022)",,,,cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Training models on data obtained from randomized experiments is ideal for
making good decisions. However, randomized experiments are often
time-consuming, expensive, risky, infeasible or unethical to perform, leaving
decision makers little choice but to rely on observational data collected under
historical policies when training models. This opens questions regarding not
only which decision-making policies would perform best in practice, but also
regarding the impact of different data collection protocols on the performance
of various policies trained on the data, or the robustness of policy
performance with respect to changes in problem characteristics such as action-
or reward- specific delays in observing outcomes. We aim to answer such
questions for the problem of optimizing sales channel allocations at LinkedIn,
where sales accounts (leads) need to be allocated to one of three channels,
with the goal of maximizing the number of successful conversions over a period
of time. A key problem feature constitutes the presence of stochastic delays in
observing allocation outcomes, whose distribution is both channel- and outcome-
dependent. We built a discrete-time simulation that can handle our problem
features and used it to evaluate: a) a historical rule-based policy; b) a
supervised machine learning policy (XGBoost); and c) multi-armed bandit (MAB)
policies, under different scenarios involving: i) data collection used for
training (observational vs randomized); ii) lead conversion scenarios; iii)
delay distributions. Our simulation results indicate that LinUCB, a simple MAB
policy, consistently outperforms the other policies, achieving a 18-47% lift
relative to a rule-based policy

that these code-writing LLMs can be re-purposed to write robot policy code,
given natural language commands. Specifically, policy code can express
functions or feedback loops that process perception outputs (e.g.,from object
detectors [2], [3]) and parameterize control primitive APIs. When provided as
input several example language commands (formatted as comments) followed by
corresponding policy code (via few-shot prompting), LLMs can take in new
commands and autonomously re-compose API calls to generate new policy code
respectively. By chaining classic logic structures and referencing third-party
libraries (e.g., NumPy, Shapely) to perform arithmetic, LLMs used in this way
can write robot policies that (i) exhibit spatial-geometric reasoning, (ii)
generalize to new instructions, and (iii) prescribe precise values (e.g.,
velocities) to ambiguous descriptions (""faster"") depending on context (i.e.,
behavioral commonsense). This paper presents code as policies: a robot-centric
formalization of language model generated programs (LMPs) that can represent
reactive policies (e.g., impedance controllers), as well as waypoint-based

maps. To tackle with this issue, this paper proposes an Expansion and Shrinkage
scheme based on the offset learning in the deformable convolution, to
sequentially improve the recall and precision of the located object in the two
respective stages. In the Expansion stage, an offset learning branch in a
deformable convolution layer, referred as ""expansion sampler"" seeks for
sampling increasingly less discriminative object regions, driven by an inverse
supervision signal that maximizes image-level classification loss. The located
more complete object in the Expansion stage is then gradually narrowed down to
the final object region during the Shrinkage stage. In the Shrinkage stage, the
offset learning branch of another deformable convolution layer, referred as
""shrinkage sampler"", is introduced to exclude the false positive background
regions attended in the Expansion stage to improve the precision of the
localization maps. We conduct various experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS

supervised approaches, which recently, have attracted extensive research
attention. A typical solution in this framework is to use self-training or
pseudo labeling to mine the supervision from the point cloud itself, but ignore
the critical information from images. In fact, cameras widely exist in LiDAR
scenarios and this complementary information seems to be greatly important for
3D applications. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modality weakly
supervised method for 3D segmentation, incorporating complementary information
from unlabeled images. Basically, we design a dual-branch network equipped with
an active labeling strategy, to maximize the power of tiny parts of labels and
directly realize 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer. Afterwards, we establish a
cross-modal self-training framework in an Expectation-Maximum (EM) perspective,
which iterates between pseudo labels estimation and parameters updating. In the
M-Step, we propose a cross-modal association learning to mine complementary
supervision from images by reinforcing the cycle-consistency between 3D points
and 2D superpixels. In the E-step, a pseudo label self-rectification mechanism
is derived to filter noise labels thus providing more accurate labels for the
networks to get fully trained. The extensive experimental results demonstrate

another sub-optimal bounding box may be detected around the attacked bounding
box to be the new true positive one. To settle this challenge, we propose to
minimize the true positive rate and maximize the false positive rate, which can
encourage more false positive objects to block the generation of new true
positive bounding boxes. It is modeled as a multi-objective optimization (MOP)
problem, of which the generic algorithm can search the Pareto-optimal. However,
our task has more than two million decision variables, leading to low searching
efficiency. Thus, we extend the standard Genetic Algorithm with Random Subset

collected during execution. The generality of the approach allows us to
robustify against prediction errors that arise under commonly imposed
assumptions in both distributed and decentralized settings. We derive tractable
finite-dimensional approximations of this class of constraints by leveraging
convex and minmax duality results for Wasserstein distributionally robust
optimization problems. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
illustrated in a multi-drone navigation setting implemented in Gazebo platform.

mental health apps available on app marketplaces, such as Google Play and Apple
App Store, many of them are not evidence-based, or have been minimally

are largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed 2159 user

findings include the critiques around inconsistent moderation standards and
lack of transparency. App-embedded social features and chatbots were criticized
for providing little support during crises. We provide research and design
implications for future mental health app developers, discuss the necessity of
developing a comprehensive and centralized app development guideline, and the
opportunities of incorporating existing AI technology in mental health
chatbots.

practical applications. However, MTS suffers from missing data problems, which
leads to degradation or even collapse of the downstream tasks, such as

dynamic positional embedding and random masking processing to characterize the
missing symptom. Second, we proposed an auto-encoder structure to obtain the

dynamic kernel and time-fliping trick to draw temporal features effectively.
Finally, the overall feed-in and loss strategy is established to ensure the

clinical applications, there is currently a lack of benchmarking results to
achieve a fair comparison so that we can select the optimal model for clinical

prediction tasks and real-world clinical practice in intensive care. To fill
these gaps, we propose two clinical prediction tasks, Outcome-specific
length-of-stay prediction and Early mortality prediction for COVID-19 patients

length-of-stay and mortality prediction tasks to accommodate the clinical
practice for COVID-19 patients. We propose fair, detailed, open-source

highly discriminative across individual points, and, at the same time, lead to
robust and consistent correspondences, through simple proximity queries. Our
framework is general and is applicable to local feature learning in both the 3D

individuals (nodes). Since relational data are often sensitive, there is an
urgent need to evaluate the privacy risks in graph data. One famous privacy
attack against data analysis models is the model inversion attack, which aims
to infer sensitive data in the training dataset and leads to great privacy
concerns. Despite its success in grid-like domains, directly applying model
inversion attacks on non-grid domains such as graph leads to poor attack
performance. This is mainly due to the failure to consider the unique
properties of graphs. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic study on
model inversion attacks against Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), one of the
state-of-the-art graph analysis tools in this paper. Firstly, in the white-box
setting where the attacker has full access to the target GNN model, we present
GraphMI to infer the private training graph data. Specifically, in GraphMI, a
projected gradient module is proposed to tackle the discreteness of graph edges
and preserve the sparsity and smoothness of graph features; a graph
auto-encoder module is used to efficiently exploit graph topology, node
attributes, and target model parameters for edge inference; a random sampling
module can finally sample discrete edges. Furthermore, in the hard-label
black-box setting where the attacker can only query the GNN API and receive the
classification results, we propose two methods based on gradient estimation and
reinforcement learning (RL-GraphMI). Our experimental results show that such
defenses are not sufficiently effective and call for more advanced defenses
against privacy attacks.

consistency and local cross-view complementarity preserving regularization to
comprehensively learn representations from multiple views. On the global stage,
we reckon that the crucial knowledge is implicitly shared among views, and
enhancing the encoder to capture such knowledge from data can improve the
discriminability of the learned representations. Hence, preserving the global
consistency of multiple views ensures the acquisition of common knowledge.
CoCoNet aligns the probabilistic distribution of views by utilizing an
efficient discrepancy metric measurement based on the generalized sliced
Wasserstein distance. Lastly on the local stage, we propose a heuristic
complementarity-factor, which joints cross-view discriminative knowledge, and
it guides the encoders to learn not only view-wise discriminability but also
cross-view complementary information. Theoretically, we provide the
information-theoretical-based analyses of our proposed CoCoNet. Empirically, to
investigate the improvement gains of our approach, we conduct adequate
experimental validations, which demonstrate that CoCoNet outperforms the

to truthfully report their data and preserve the privacy of individuals'
reports, while their outputs should also close to the underlying parameter. In
the first part of the paper, we consider the case where the covariates are
sub-Gaussian and the responses are heavy-tailed where they only have the finite
fourth moments. First, motivated by the stationary condition of the maximizer
of the likelihood function, we derive a novel private and closed form
estimator. Based on the estimator, we propose a mechanism which has the
following properties via some appropriate design of the computation and payment
scheme for several canonical models such as linear regression, logistic
regression and Poisson regression: (1) the mechanism is $o(1)$-jointly
differentially private (with probability at least $1-o(1)$); (2) it is an

of agents to truthfully report their data, where $n$ is the number of agents;
(3) the output could achieve an error of $o(1)$ to the underlying parameter;
(4) it is individually rational for a $(1-o(1))$ fraction of agents in the
mechanism ; (5) the payment budget required from the analyst to run the
mechanism is $o(1)$. In the second part, we consider the linear regression

have individual cost functions to minimize subject to subspace constraints that
require the minimizers across the network to lie in low-dimensional subspaces.
This constrained formulation includes consensus or single-task optimization as
special cases, and allows for more general task relatedness models such as
multitask smoothness and coupled optimization. In order to cope with
communication constraints, we propose and study an adaptive decentralized
strategy where the agents employ differential randomized quantizers to compress
their estimates before communicating with their neighbors. The analysis shows
that, under some general conditions on the quantization noise, and for
sufficiently small step-sizes $\mu$, the strategy is stable both in terms of
mean-square error and average bit rate: by reducing $\mu$, it is possible to
keep the estimation errors small (on the order of $\mu$) without increasing
indefinitely the bit rate as $\mu\rightarrow 0$. Simulations illustrate the
theoretical findings and the effectiveness of the proposed approach, revealing
that decentralized learning is achievable at the expense of only a few bits.

method for reconstructing material models from measured wave signals. In the
field of seismic exploration, FWI has proven particularly successful in the
reconstruction of smoothly varying material deviations. In contrast,
non-destructive testing (NDT) often requires the detection and specification of
sharp defects in a specimen. If the contrast between materials is low, FWI can
be successfully applied to these problems as well. However, so far the method
is not fully suitable to image defects such as voids, which are characterized
by a high contrast in the material parameters. In this paper, we introduce a
dimensionless scaling function $\gamma$ to model voids in the forward and
inverse scalar wave equation problem. Depending on which material parameters
this function $\gamma$ scales, different modeling approaches are presented,
leading to three formulations of mono-parameter FWI and one formulation of
two-parameter FWI. The resulting problems are solved by first-order
optimization, where the gradient is computed by an ajdoint state method. The
corresponding Fr\'echet kernels are derived for each approach and the
associated minimization is performed using an L-BFGS algorithm. A comparison
between the different approaches shows that scaling the density with $\gamma$
is most promising for parameterizing voids in the forward and inverse problem.
Finally, in order to consider arbitrary complex geometries known a priori, this
approach is combined with an immersed boundary method, the finite cell method
(FCM).

labels as supervision, highly rely on the initial class activation map (CAM)
generated from the standard classification network. In this paper, a novel
""Progressive Patch Learning"" approach is proposed to improve the local details
extraction of the classification, producing the CAM better covering the whole
object rather than only the most discriminative regions as in CAMs obtained in
conventional classification models. ""Patch Learning"" destructs the feature maps
into patches and independently processes each local patch in parallel before
the final aggregation. Such a mechanism enforces the network to find weak
information from the scattered discriminative local parts, achieving enhanced
local details sensitivity. ""Progressive Patch Learning"" further extends the
feature destruction and patch learning to multi-level granularities in a
progressive manner. Cooperating with a multi-stage optimization strategy, such
a ""Progressive Patch Learning"" mechanism implicitly provides the model with the
feature extraction ability across different locality-granularities. As an
alternative to the implicit multi-granularity progressive fusion approach, we
additionally propose an explicit method to simultaneously fuse features from
different granularities in a single model, further enhancing the CAM quality on
the full object coverage. Our proposed method achieves outstanding performance
on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset e.g., with 69.6$% mIoU on the test set), which

While the need for biomedical fact-checking has been recognized in recent
years, user-generated medical content has received comparably little attention.
At the same time, models for other text genres might not be reusable, because
the claims they have been trained with are substantially different. For
instance, claims in the SciFact dataset are short and focused: ""Side effects
associated with antidepressants increases risk of stroke"". In contrast, social
media holds naturally-occurring claims, often embedded in additional context:
""`If you take antidepressants like SSRIs, you could be at risk of a condition
called serotonin syndrome' Serotonin syndrome nearly killed me in 2010. Had
symptoms of stroke and seizure."" This showcases the mismatch between real-world
medical claims and the input that existing fact-checking systems expect. To
make user-generated content checkable by existing models, we propose to
reformulate the social-media input in such a way that the resulting claim
mimics the claim characteristics in established datasets. To accomplish this,
our method condenses the claim with the help of relational entity information
and either compiles the claim out of an entity-relation-entity triple or
extracts the shortest phrase that contains these elements. We show that the
reformulated input improves the performance of various fact-checking models as
opposed to checking the tweet text in its entirety.

labeled data is usually more time-consuming and costly than unlabeled data.
When ID labeled data is limited, the previous OOD detection methods are no
longer superior due to their high dependence on the amount of ID labeled data.
Based on limited ID labeled data and sufficient unlabeled data, we define a new
setting called Weakly-Supervised Out-of-Distribution Detection (WSOOD). To
solve the new problem, we propose an effective method called Topological
Structure Learning (TSL). Firstly, TSL uses a contrastive learning method to
build the initial topological structure space for ID and OOD data. Secondly,
TSL mines effective topological connections in the initial topological space.
Finally, based on limited ID labeled data and mined topological connections,
TSL reconstructs the topological structure in a new topological space to
increase the separability of ID and OOD instances. Extensive studies on several

enhanced ductile response after heat treatment (HT) and hot isostatic pressing
(HIP) post-processes. A Phase Field framework is adopted to capture damage
nucleation and propagation from two different notch geometries and a discussion
on the influence of fracture energy and the characteristic length is carried
out. In addition, the influence of oxygen uptake is analysed by reproducing
non-inert atmospheres during HT and HIP, showing that oxygen shifts fracture to
brittle failures due to the formation of an alpha case layer, especially for
the V-notch geometry. Results show that a pure elastic behaviour can be assumed
for the as-built SLM condition, whereas elastic-plastic phenomena must be
modelled for specimens subjected to heat treatment or hot isostatic pressing.
The present brittle Phase Field framework coupled with an elastic-plastic

fracture after different post-processing routes.

contraction through low-energy electrical signals. FES can animate paralysed
limbs. Yet, an open challenge remains on how to apply FES to achieve desired
movements. This challenge is accentuated by the complexities of human bodies
and the non-stationarities of the muscles' responses. The former causes
difficulties in performing inverse dynamics, and the latter causes control
performance to degrade over extended periods of use. Here, we engage the
challenge via a data-driven approach. Specifically, we learn to control FES
through Reinforcement Learning (RL) which can automatically customise the
stimulation for the patients. However, RL typically has Markovian assumptions
while FES control systems are non-Markovian because of the non-stationarities.
To deal with this problem, we use a recurrent neural network to create
Markovian state representations. We cast FES controls into RL problems and
train RL agents to control FES in different settings in both simulations and
the real world. The results show that our RL controllers can maintain control
performances over long periods and have better stimulation characteristics than
PID controllers.

such as autonomous driving and robot navigation. Recent state-of-the-art models
trained on large-scale benchmarks have been pushing the limit of performance
rapidly, mainly focusing on improving prediction accuracy. However, those
models put less emphasis on efficiency, which is critical for real-time
applications. This paper proposes an attention-based graph model named GATraj
with a much higher prediction speed. Spatial-temporal dynamics of agents, e.g.,
pedestrians or vehicles, are modeled by attention mechanisms. Interactions
among agents are modeled by a graph convolutional network. We also implement a
Laplacian mixture decoder to mitigate mode collapse and generate diverse
multimodal predictions for each agent. Our model achieves performance on par
with the state-of-the-art models at a much higher prediction speed tested on
multiple open datasets.

  Augmentation",,,,,cs.DS,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Connectivity augmentation problems are among the most elementary questions in
Network Design. Many of these problems admit natural $2$-approximation
algorithms, often through various classic techniques, whereas it remains open
whether approximation factors below $2$ can be achieved. One of the most basic
examples thereof is the Weighted Connectivity Augmentation Problem (WCAP). In
WCAP, one is given an undirected graph together with a set of additional
weighted candidate edges, and the task is to find a cheapest set of candidate
edges whose addition to the graph increases its edge-connectivity. We present a
$(1.5+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for WCAP, showing for the first
time that factors below $2$ are achievable.
  On a high level, we design a well-chosen local search algorithm, inspired by
recent advances for Weighted Tree Augmentation. To measure progress, we
consider a directed weakening of WCAP and show that it has highly structured
planar solutions. Interpreting a solution of the original problem as one of
this directed weakening allows us to describe local exchange steps in a clean
and algorithmically amenable way. Leveraging these insights, we show that we
can efficiently search for good exchange steps within a component class for
link sets that is closely related to bounded treewidth subgraphs of circle
graphs. Moreover, we prove that an optimum solution can be decomposed into
smaller components, at least one of which leads to a good local search step as
long as we did not yet achieve the claimed approximation guarantee.

faults of large-scale software systems. During the past decades, many log
analysis approaches have been proposed to detect system anomalies reflected by
logs. They usually take log event counts or sequential log events as inputs and
utilize machine learning algorithms including deep learning models to detect
system anomalies. These anomalies are often identified as violations of
quantitative relational patterns or sequential patterns of log events in log
sequences. However, existing methods fail to leverage the spatial structural
relationships among log events, resulting in potential false alarms and
unstable performance. In this study, we propose a novel graph-based log anomaly
detection method, LogGD, to effectively address the issue by transforming log

Neural Network, which combines graph structure and node semantics for log-based
anomaly detection. We evaluate the proposed method on four widely-used public

stable performance under different window size settings. The results confirm
that LogGD is effective in log-based anomaly detection.

research. Based on the 2-norm of dual quaternion vectors, we propose a new dual
quaternion optimization method for the hand-eye calibration problem. The dual
quaternion optimization problem is decomposed to two quaternion optimization
subproblems. The first quaternion optimization subproblem governs the rotation
of the robot hand. It can be solved efficiently by the eigenvalue decomposition
or singular value decomposition. If the optimal value of the first quaternion
optimization subproblem is zero, then the system is rotationwise noiseless,
i.e., there exists a ``perfect'' robot hand motion which meets all the testing
poses rotationwise exactly. In this case, we apply the regularization technique
for solving the second subproblem to minimize the distance of the translation.
Otherwise we apply the patching technique to solve the second quaternion
optimization subproblem. Then solving the second quaternion optimization
subproblem turns out to be solving a quadratically constrained quadratic
program. In this way, we give a complete description for the solution set of
hand-eye calibration problems. This is new in the hand-eye calibration

attributes. Definition of the attributes, however, is elusive and varies across
different datasets. Furthermore, leveraging these attributes at input level to
bias mitigation may leave a gap between intrinsic properties and the underlying
decision rule. To narrow down this gap and liberate the supervision on bias, we
suggest extending bias mitigation into feature space. Therefore, a novel model,
Recovering Intended-Feature Subspace with Knowledge-Free (RISK) is developed.
Assuming that shortcut features caused by various biases are unintended for
prediction, RISK views them as redundant features. When delving into a lower
manifold to remove redundancies, RISK reveals that an extremely low-dimensional
subspace with intended features can robustly represent the highly biased

of model predictive robustness, which provides a more systematic way of
evaluating robustness compared to previous approaches by considering
model-based predictions. In particular, we use Gaussian process regression to
learn the robustness based on precomputed predictions so that robustness values

of autonomous driving with predicates used in formalized traffic rules on a

scenarios, since it could generate the predicted control sequence only relying
on the historical input and output data. Recently, based on cloud computing,
data-driven predictive cloud control system (DPCCS) has been proposed with the
advantage of sufficient computational resources. However, the existing
computation mode of DPCCS is centralized. This computation mode could not
utilize fully the computing power of cloud computing, of which the structure is
distributed. Thus, the computation delay could not been reduced and still
affects the control quality. In this paper, a novel cloud-edge collaborative
containerised workflow-based DPC system with disturbance observer (DOB) is
proposed, to improve the computation efficiency and guarantee the control
accuracy. First, a construction method for the DPC workflow is designed, to
match the distributed processing environment of cloud computing. But the
non-computation overheads of the workflow tasks are relatively high. Therefore,
a cloud-edge collaborative control scheme with DOB is designed. The low-weight
data could be truncated to reduce the non-computation overheads. Meanwhile, we
design an edge DOB to estimate and compensate the uncertainty in cloud workflow
processing, and obtain the composite control variable. The UUB stability of the
DOB is also proved. Third, to execute the workflow-based DPC controller and
evaluate the proposed cloud-edge collaborative control scheme with DOB in the
real cloud environment, we design and implement a practical workflow-based
cloud control experimental system based on container technology. Finally, a
series of evaluations show that, the computation times are decreased by 45.19%

source domain data is often restricted, due to concerns over patient data
privacy or intellectual property. To sidestep this, we propose ""off-the-shelf
(OS)"" UDA (OSUDA), aimed at image segmentation, by adapting an OS segmentor
trained in a source domain to a target domain, in the absence of source domain
data in adaptation. Toward this goal, we aim to develop a novel batch-wise
normalization (BN) statistics adaptation framework. In particular, we gradually
adapt the domain-specific low-order BN statistics, e.g., mean and variance,
through an exponential momentum decay strategy, while explicitly enforcing the
consistency of the domain shareable high-order BN statistics, e.g., scaling and
shifting factors, via our optimization objective. We also adaptively quantify
the channel-wise transferability to gauge the importance of each channel, via
both low-order statistics divergence and a scaling factor.~Furthermore, we
incorporate unsupervised self-entropy minimization into our framework to boost
performance alongside a novel queued, memory-consistent self-training strategy
to utilize the reliable pseudo label for stable and efficient unsupervised
adaptation. We evaluated our OSUDA-based framework on both cross-modality and
cross-subtype brain tumor segmentation and cardiac MR to CT segmentation tasks.
Our experimental results showed that our memory consistent OSUDA performs
better than existing source-relaxed UDA methods and yields similar performance
to UDA methods with source data.

  of Risky Objects in Driving Videos",Submitted to IEEE-T-ITS,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Detecting dangerous traffic agents in videos captured by vehicle-mounted
dashboard cameras (dashcams) is essential to facilitate safe navigation in a
complex environment. Accident-related videos are just a minor portion of the
driving video big data, and the transient pre-accident processes are highly
dynamic and complex. Besides, risky and non-risky traffic agents can be similar
in their appearance. These make risky object localization in the driving video
particularly challenging. To this end, this paper proposes an attention-guided
multistream feature fusion network (AM-Net) to localize dangerous traffic
agents from dashcam videos. Two Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks use object
bounding box and optical flow features extracted from consecutive video frames
to capture spatio-temporal cues for distinguishing dangerous traffic agents. An
attention module coupled with the GRUs learns to attend to the traffic agents
relevant to an accident. Fusing the two streams of features, AM-Net predicts
the riskiness scores of traffic agents in the video. In supporting this study,
the paper also introduces a benchmark dataset called Risky Object Localization
(ROL). The dataset contains spatial, temporal, and categorical annotations with
the accident, object, and scene-level attributes. The proposed AM-Net achieves
a promising performance of 85.73% AUC on the ROL dataset. Meanwhile, the AM-Net
outperforms current state-of-the-art for video anomaly detection by 6.3% AUC on
the DoTA dataset. A thorough ablation study further reveals AM-Net's merits by

background/foreground separation, change detection, anomaly detection,
tracking, and more. However, while learning such a model in a video captured by
a static camera is a fairly-solved task, in the case of a Moving-camera
Background Model (MCBM), the success has been far more modest due to
algorithmic and scalability challenges that arise due to the camera motion.
Thus, existing MCBMs are limited in their scope and their supported
camera-motion types. These hurdles also impeded the employment, in this
unsupervised task, of end-to-end solutions based on deep learning (DL).
Moreover, existing MCBMs usually model the background either on the domain of a
typically-large panoramic image or in an online fashion. Unfortunately, the
former creates several problems, including poor scalability, while the latter
prevents the recognition and leveraging of cases where the camera revisits
previously-seen parts of the scene. This paper proposes a new method, called
DeepMCBM, that eliminates all the aforementioned issues and achieves
state-of-the-art results. Concretely, first we identify the difficulties
associated with joint alignment of video frames in general and in a DL setting
in particular. Next, we propose a new strategy for joint alignment that lets us
use a spatial transformer net with neither a regularization nor any form of
specialized (and non-differentiable) initialization. Coupled with an
autoencoder conditioned on unwarped robust central moments (obtained from the
joint alignment), this yields an end-to-end regularization-free MCBM that
supports a broad range of camera motions and scales gracefully. We demonstrate
DeepMCBM's utility on a variety of videos, including ones beyond the scope of
other methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/DeepMCBM .

breakthrough makes people wonder: how does a GNN make such decisions, and can
we trust its prediction with high confidence? When it comes to some critical
fields such as biomedicine, where making wrong decisions can have severe
consequences, interpreting the inner working mechanisms of GNNs before applying
them is crucial. In this paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic model-level
explanation method for different GNNs that follow the message passing scheme,
GNNInterpreter, to explain the high-level decision-making process of the GNN
model. More specifically, with continuous relaxation of graphs and the
reparameterization trick, GNNInterpreter learns a probabilistic generative
graph distribution which produces the most representative graph for the target
prediction in the eye of the GNN model. Compared with the only existing work,
GNNInterpreter is more computationally efficient and more flexible in
generating explanation graphs with different types of node features and edge
features, without introducing another blackbox to explain the GNN and without
requiring domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, the experimental studies
conducted on four different datasets demonstrate that the explanation graph
generated by GNNInterpreter can match the desired graph pattern when the model
is ideal and reveal potential model pitfalls if there exist any.

Instead, recent research in dynamic convolution shows that learning a linear

attentions can significantly improve the accuracy of light-weight CNNs, while
maintaining efficient inference. However, we observe that existing works endow
convolutional kernels with the dynamic property through one dimension
(regarding the convolutional kernel number) of the kernel space, but the other
three dimensions (regarding the spatial size, the input channel number and the
output channel number for each convolutional kernel) are overlooked. Inspired
by this, we present Omni-dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv), a more
generalized yet elegant dynamic convolution design, to advance this line of
research. ODConv leverages a novel multi-dimensional attention mechanism with a
parallel strategy to learn complementary attentions for convolutional kernels
along all four dimensions of the kernel space at any convolutional layer. As a
drop-in replacement of regular convolutions, ODConv can be plugged into many
CNN architectures. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets
show that ODConv brings solid accuracy boosts for various prevailing CNN
backbones including both light-weight and large ones, e.g.,
3.77%~5.71%|1.86%~3.72% absolute top-1 improvements to MobivleNetV2|ResNet

learning ability, ODConv with even one single kernel can compete with or

substantially reducing extra parameters. Furthermore, ODConv is also superior

achieve loop closing or global localization. In this paper, we tackle the
problem of place recognition based on sequential 3D LiDAR scans obtained by an

generate a global descriptor for each sequence of LiDAR range images in an
end-to-end fashion. During online operation, our SeqOT finds similar places by
matching such descriptors between the current query sequence and those stored
in the map. We evaluate our approach on four datasets collected with different
types of LiDAR sensors in different environments. The experimental results show
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR-based place recognition

  based on the fixed-stress concept","26 pages, 16 figures, 5 tables",,,,math.NA cs.NA physics.app-ph,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Phase field models are promising to tackle various fracture problems where a
diffusive crack is introduced and modelled using the phase variable. Owing to
the non-convexity of the energy functional, the derived partial differential
equations are usually solved in a staggered manner. However, this method
suffers from a low convergence rate, and a large number of staggered iterations
are needed, especially at the fracture nucleation and propagation. In this
study, we propose novel staggered schemes, which are inspired by the
fixed-stress split scheme in poromechanics. By fixing the stress when solving
the damage evolution, the displacement increment is expressed in terms of the
increment of the phase variable. The relation between these two increments
enables a prediction of the displacement and the active energy based on the
increment of the phase variable. Thus, the maximum number of staggered
iterations is reduced, and the computational efficiency is improved. We present
three staggered schemes by fixing the first invariant, second invariant, or
both invariants of the stress, denoted by S1, S2, and S3 schemes. The
performance of the schemes is then verified by comparing with the standard
staggered scheme through three benchmark examples, i.e., tensile, shear, and
L-shape panel tests. The results exhibit that the force-displacement relations
and the crack patterns computed using the fast schemes are consistent with the
ones based on the standard staggered scheme. Moreover, the proposed S1 and S2
schemes can largely reduce the maximum number of staggered iterations and total
CPU time in all benchmark tests. The S2 scheme performs comparably except in
the shear test, where the underlying assumption is violated in the region close
to the crack.

transitive closure of the DAG for which several forms are possible depending on
the interpretation of the edge weights. Examples include level of influence,
distance, or pollution distribution. Our framework is different from prior GSP:
it is specific to DAGs and leverages, and extends, the classical theory of
Moebius inversion from combinatorics. For a prototypical application we
consider DAGs modeling dynamic networks in which edges change over time.
Specifically, we model the spread of an infection on such a DAG obtained from
real-world contact tracing data and learn the infection signal from samples

type-2 Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) system with unknown time-varying delay in state and

almost all systems. It can make many problems and instability while the system
is working. In this paper, the time-varying delay is considered in both states
and input vectors and is the sensible difference between the proposed method
here and previous algorithms, besides, it is unknown but bounded. To solve the
problem, the Razumikhin approach is applied to the proposed method since it
includes a Lyapunov function with the original nonaugmented state space of
system models compared to Krasovskii formula. On the other hand, the Razumikhin
method act better and avoids the inherent complexity of the Krasovskii

output results, the model predictive control (MPC) is designed for the system

optimal stopping theory with several applications to mechanism design and
online optimization. We study the cost minimization counterpart of the
classical prophet inequality, where one is facing a sequence of costs $X_1,
X_2, \dots, X_n$ in an online manner and must ''stop'' at some point and take
the last cost seen. Given that the $X_i$'s are independent, drawn from known
distributions, the goal is to devise a stopping strategy $S$ (online algorithm)
that minimizes the expected cost.
  We first observe that if the $X_i$'s are not identically distributed, then no
strategy can achieve a bounded approximation, no matter if the arrival order is
adversarial or random. This leads us to consider the case where the $X_i$'s are
I.I.D.. For the I.I.D. case, we give a complete characterization of the optimal
stopping strategy. We show that it achieves a (distribution-dependent)
constant-factor approximation to the prophet's cost for almost all
distributions and that this constant is tight. In particular, for distributions
for which the integral of the hazard rate is a polynomial $H(x) = \sum_{i=1}^k
a_i x^{d_i}$, where $d_1 < \dots < d_k$, the approximation factor is
$\lambda(d_1)$, a decreasing function of $d_1$. Furthermore, for MHR
distributions, we show that this constant is at most $2$, and this is again
tight.
  We also analyze single-threshold strategies for the cost prophet inequality
problem. We design a threshold that achieves a
$\operatorname{O}(\operatorname{polylog}n)$-factor approximation, where the
exponent in the logarithmic factor is a distribution-dependent constant, and we
show a matching lower bound.
  We believe that our results are of independent interest for analyzing
approximately optimal (posted price-style) mechanisms for procuring items.

CNN and Transformer-based methods usually first generate a bird's-eye-view
(BEV) feature map from the front view image, and then use a sub-network with
BEV feature map as input to predict 3D lanes. Such approaches require an
explicit view transformation between BEV and front view, which itself is still
a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose CurveFormer, a single-stage
Transformer-based method that directly calculates 3D lane parameters and can
circumvent the difficult view transformation step. Specifically, we formulate
3D lane detection as a curve propagation problem by using curve queries. A 3D
lane query is represented by a dynamic and ordered anchor point set. In this
way, queries with curve representation in Transformer decoder iteratively
refine the 3D lane detection results. Moreover, a curve cross-attention module
is introduced to compute the similarities between curve queries and image
features. Additionally, a context sampling module that can capture more
relative image features of a curve query is provided to further boost the 3D
lane detection performance. We evaluate our method for 3D lane detection on

from large amounts of data using tasks that do not require costly labeling.
Mode collapse, i.e., the model producing identical representations for all
inputs, is a central problem to many self-supervised learning approaches,
making self-supervised tasks, such as matching distorted variants of the
inputs, ineffective. In this article, we argue that a straightforward
application of information maximization among alternative latent
representations of the same input naturally solves the collapse problem and
achieves competitive empirical results. We propose a self-supervised learning
method, CorInfoMax, that uses a second-order statistics-based mutual
information measure that reflects the level of correlation among its arguments.
Maximizing this correlative information measure between alternative
representations of the same input serves two purposes: (1) it avoids the
collapse problem by generating feature vectors with non-degenerate covariances;
(2) it establishes relevance among alternative representations by increasing
the linear dependence among them. An approximation of the proposed information
maximization objective simplifies to a Euclidean distance-based objective
function regularized by the log-determinant of the feature covariance matrix.
The regularization term acts as a natural barrier against feature space
degeneracy. Consequently, beyond avoiding complete output collapse to a single
point, the proposed approach also prevents dimensional collapse by encouraging
the spread of information across the whole feature space. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that CorInfoMax achieves better or competitive performance results

phase field system related to free energy, including the elastic energy and
logarithmic type functionals. To address the challenge posed by the particular
free energy functional, we propose a semi-implicit scheme based on the discrete
variational derivative method, which is unconditionally energy stable and
maintains the energy dissipation law and the mass conservation law. Due to the
good stability of the semi-implicit scheme, the adaptive time step strategy is
adopted, which can flexibly control the time step according to the dynamic
evolution of the problem. A domain decomposition based, parallel
Newton--Krylov--Schwarz method is introduced to solve the nonlinear algebraic
system constructed by the discretization at each time step. Numerical
experiments show that the proposed algorithm is energy stable with large time
steps, and highly scalable to six thousand processor cores.

  Scaling",,,,,math.ST cs.LG stat.ML stat.TH,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The Gaussian kernel and its traditional normalizations (e.g., row-stochastic)
are popular approaches for assessing similarities between data points, commonly
used for manifold learning and clustering, as well as supervised and
semi-supervised learning on graphs. In many practical situations, the data can
be corrupted by noise that prohibits traditional affinity matrices from
correctly assessing similarities, especially if the noise magnitudes vary
considerably across the data, e.g., under heteroskedasticity or outliers. An
alternative approach that provides a more stable behavior under noise is the
doubly stochastic normalization of the Gaussian kernel. In this work, we
investigate this normalization in a setting where points are sampled from an
unknown density on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in high-dimensional
space and corrupted by possibly strong, non-identically distributed,
sub-Gaussian noise. We establish the pointwise concentration of the doubly
stochastic affinity matrix and its scaling factors around certain population
forms. We then utilize these results to develop several tools for robust
inference. First, we derive a robust density estimator that can substantially
outperform the standard kernel density estimator under high-dimensional noise.
Second, we provide estimators for the pointwise noise magnitudes, the pointwise
signal magnitudes, and the pairwise Euclidean distances between clean data
points. Lastly, we derive robust graph Laplacian normalizations that
approximate popular manifold Laplacians, including the Laplace Beltrami
operator, showing that the local geometry of the manifold can be recovered
under high-dimensional noise. We exemplify our results in simulations and on
real single-cell RNA-sequencing data. In the latter, we show that our proposed
normalizations are robust to technical variability associated with different
cell types.

stability and generalization error which extends the existing results for
uniform stability \cite{lei2021stability}. We further develop the first nearly

the optimal generalization bounds can be attained for both smooth and

overcoming the effects of catastrophic forgetting, which describes the sudden
drop of accuracy on previously learned classes after the model is trained on a
new set of classes. Despite latest advances in mitigating catastrophic
forgetting, the underlying causes of forgetting specifically in CiSS are not
well understood. Therefore, in a set of experiments and representational

bias towards new classes are the major causes of forgetting in CiSS.
Furthermore, we show that both causes mostly manifest themselves in deeper
classification layers of the network, while the early layers of the model are
not affected. Finally, we demonstrate how both causes are effectively mitigated
utilizing the information contained in the background, with the help of

(BST) data structure: in STTs the underlying search space is an arbitrary tree,
whereas in BSTs it is a path. An optimal BST of size $n$ can be computed for a
given distribution of queries in $O(n^2)$ time [Knuth 1971] and centroid BSTs
provide a nearly-optimal alternative, computable in $O(n)$ time [Mehlhorn
1977].
  By contrast, optimal STTs are not known to be computable in polynomial time,
and the fastest constant-approximation algorithm runs in $O(n^3)$ time
[Berendsohn, Kozma 2022]. Centroid trees can be defined for STTs analogously to
BSTs, and they have been used in a wide range of algorithmic applications. In
the unweighted case (i.e., for a uniform distribution of queries), a centroid
tree can be computed in $O(n)$ time [Brodal et al. 2001; Della Giustina et al.
2019]. These algorithms, however, do not readily extend to the weighted case.
Moreover, no approximation guarantees were previously known for centroid trees
in either the unweighted or weighted cases.
  In this paper we revisit centroid trees in a general, weighted setting, and
we settle both the algorithmic complexity of constructing them, and the quality
of their approximation. For constructing a weighted centroid tree, we give an
output-sensitive $O(n\log h)\subseteq O(n\log n)$ time algorithm, where $h$ is
the height of the resulting centroid tree. If the weights are of polynomial
complexity, the running time is $O(n\log\log n)$. We show these bounds to be
optimal, in a general decision tree model of computation. For approximation, we
prove that the cost of a centroid tree is at most twice the optimum, and this
guarantee is best possible, both in the weighted and unweighted cases. We also
give tight, fine-grained bounds on the approximation-ratio for bounded-degree
trees and on the approximation-ratio of more general $\alpha$-centroid trees.

produced at an ever-increasing pace. Classical archival methods aimed at easing
information retrieval. Nowadays, archiving is not enough anymore. The amount of
data that gets generated daily is beyond human comprehension, and appeals for
new information retrieval strategies. Instead of referencing every single data
piece as in traditional archival techniques, a more relevant approach consists
in understanding the overall ideas conveyed in data flows. To spot such general
tendencies, a precise comprehension of the underlying data generation
mechanisms is required. In the rich literature tackling this problem, the
question of information interaction remains nearly unexplored. First, we
investigate the frequency of such interactions. Building on recent advances
made in Stochastic Block Modelling, we explore the role of interactions in
several social networks. We find that interactions are rare in these datasets.
Then, we wonder how interactions evolve over time. Earlier data pieces should
not have an everlasting influence on ulterior data generation mechanisms. We
model this using dynamic network inference advances. We conclude that
interactions are brief. Finally, we design a framework that jointly models rare
and brief interactions based on Dirichlet-Hawkes Processes. We argue that this
new class of models fits brief and sparse interaction modelling. We conduct a
large-scale application on Reddit and find that interactions play a minor role
in this dataset. From a broader perspective, our work results in a collection
of highly flexible models and in a rethinking of core concepts of machine

data was recently framed as a purely continuous optimization problem by
leveraging a differentiable acyclicity characterization of DAGs based on the
trace of a matrix exponential function. Existing acyclicity characterizations
are based on the idea that powers of an adjacency matrix contain information
about walks and cycles. In this work, we propose a $\textit{fundamentally
different}$ acyclicity characterization based on the log-determinant (log-det)
function, which leverages the nilpotency property of DAGs. To deal with the
inherent asymmetries of a DAG, we relate the domain of our log-det
characterization to the set of $\textit{M-matrices}$, which is a key difference
to the classical log-det function defined over the cone of positive definite
matrices. Similar to acyclicity functions previously proposed, our
characterization is also exact and differentiable. However, when compared to
existing characterizations, our log-det function: (1) Is better at detecting
large cycles; (2) Has better-behaved gradients; and (3) Its runtime is in
practice about an order of magnitude faster. From the optimization side, we
drop the typically used augmented Lagrangian scheme, and propose DAGMA
($\textit{Directed Acyclic Graphs via M-matrices for Acyclicity}$), a method
that resembles the central path for barrier methods. Each point in the central
path of DAGMA is a solution to an unconstrained problem regularized by our
log-det function, then we show that at the limit of the central path the
solution is guaranteed to be a DAG. Finally, we provide extensive experiments
for $\textit{linear}$ and $\textit{nonlinear}$ SEMs, and show that our approach

all almost-optimal models. Rashomon sets can be extremely complicated,
particularly for highly nonlinear function classes that allow complex
interaction terms, such as decision trees. We provide the first technique for
completely enumerating the Rashomon set for sparse decision trees; in fact, our
work provides the first complete enumeration of any Rashomon set for a
non-trivial problem with a highly nonlinear discrete function class. This
allows the user an unprecedented level of control over model choice among all
models that are approximately equally good. We represent the Rashomon set in a
specialized data structure that supports efficient querying and sampling. We
show three applications of the Rashomon set: 1) it can be used to study
variable importance for the set of almost-optimal trees (as opposed to a single
tree), 2) the Rashomon set for accuracy enables enumeration of the Rashomon
sets for balanced accuracy and F1-score, and 3) the Rashomon set for a full

2209.08042,Swagato Sanyal,"Rahul Chugh, Supartha Podder and Swagato Sanyal",Decision Tree Complexity versus Block Sensitivity and Degree,,,,,cs.CC,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Relations between the decision tree complexity and various other complexity
measures of Boolean functions is a thriving topic of research in computational
complexity. It is known that decision tree complexity is bounded above by the
cube of block sensitivity, and the cube of polynomial degree. However, the
widest separation between decision tree complexity and each of block
sensitivity and degree that is witnessed by known Boolean functions is
quadratic. In this work, we investigate the tightness of the existing cubic
upper bounds.
  We improve the cubic upper bounds for many interesting classes of Boolean
functions. We show that for graph properties and for functions with a constant
number of alternations, both of the cubic upper bounds can be improved to
quadratic. We define a class of Boolean functions, which we call the zebra
functions, that comprises Boolean functions where each monotone path from 0^n
to 1^n has an equal number of alternations. This class contains the symmetric
and monotone functions as its subclasses. We show that for any zebra function,
decision tree complexity is at most the square of block sensitivity, and
certificate complexity is at most the square of degree.
  Finally, we show using a lifting theorem of communication complexity by
G{\""{o}}{\""{o}}s, Pitassi and Watson that the task of proving an improved upper
bound on the decision tree complexity for all functions is in a sense
equivalent to the potentially easier task of proving a similar upper bound on
communication complexity for each bi-partition of the input variables, for all
functions. In particular, this implies that to bound the decision tree
complexity it suffices to bound smaller measures like parity decision tree
complexity, subcube decision tree complexity and decision tree rank, that are
defined in terms of models that can be efficiently simulated by communication
protocols.

overestimation in reinforced agents for learning unbiased and effective

various functionalities, such as messaging and gaming. App developers try their
best to ensure user experience during app development and maintenance to
improve the rating of their apps on app platforms and attract more user
downloads. Previous studies indicated that responding to users' reviews tends
to change their attitude towards the apps positively. Users who have been
replied are more likely to update the given ratings. However, reading and
responding to every user review is not an easy task for developers since it is
common for popular apps to receive tons of reviews every day. Thus, automation
tools for review replying are needed.
  To address the need above, the paper introduces a Transformer-based approach,
named TRRGen, to automatically generate responses to given user reviews. TRRGen
extracts apps' categories, rating, and review text as the input features. By
adapting a Transformer-based model, TRRGen can generate appropriate replies for
new reviews. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on the real-world datasets
indicate that the proposed approach can generate high-quality replies for

demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

extensively studied. Recent studies show that neural-based models are effective
in learning contextual representation for tabular data. The learning of an
effective contextual representation requires meaningful features and a large
amount of data. However, current methods often fail to properly learn a
contextual representation from the features without semantic information. In
addition, it's intractable to enlarge the training set through mixed tabular
datasets due to the difference between datasets. To address these problems, we
propose a novel framework PTab, using the Pre-trained language model to model
Tabular data. PTab learns a contextual representation of tabular data through a
three-stage processing: Modality Transformation(MT), Masked-Language
Fine-tuning(MF), and Classification Fine-tuning(CF). We initialize our model
with a pre-trained Model (PTM) which contains semantic information learned from
the large-scale language data. Consequently, contextual representation can be
learned effectively during the fine-tuning stages. In addition, we can
naturally mix the textualized tabular data to enlarge the training set to
further improve representation learning. We evaluate PTab on eight popular
tabular classification datasets. Experimental results show that our method has
achieved a better average AUC score in supervised settings compared to the
state-of-the-art baselines(e.g. XGBoost), and outperforms counterpart methods
under semi-supervised settings. We present visualization results that show PTab
has well instance-based interpretability.

a major issue for vehicular communication, specially, when the number of

such as broadcast problem. Clustering can solve the issues of vehicular ad hoc
network (VANET); however, due to the high mobility of the vehicles, clustering
in VANET suffers stability issue. Previously proposed clustering algorithms for
VANET are optimized for either straight road or for intersection. Moreover, the
absence of the intelligent use of a combination of the mobility parameters,
such as direction, movement, position, velocity, degree of vehicle, movement at
the intersection etc., results in cluster stability issues. A dynamic
clustering algorithm considering the efficient use of all the mobility
parameters can solve the stability problem in VANET. To achieve higher
stability for VANET, a novel robust and dynamic clustering algorithm stable
dynamic predictive clustering (SDPC) for VANET is proposed in this paper. In
contrast to previous studies, vehicle relative velocity, vehicle position,
vehicle distance, transmission range, and vehicle density are considered in the
creation of a cluster, whereas relative distance, movement at the intersection,
degree of vehicles are considered to select the cluster head. From the mobility
parameters the future road scenario is constructed. The cluster is created, and
the cluster head is selected based on the future construction of the road. The
performance of SDPC is compared in terms of the average cluster head change

and computer vision tasks. One traditional strategy is to convert the RGB image
to a less correlated color space and denoise each channel of the new space
separately. However, such a strategy can not fully exploit the correlated
information between channels and is inadequate to obtain satisfactory results.
To address this issue, this paper proposes a new multi-channel optimization
model for color image denoising under the nuclear norm minus Frobenius norm
minimization framework. Specifically, based on the block-matching, the color
image is decomposed into overlapping RGB patches. For each patch, we stack its
similar neighbors to form the corresponding patch matrix. The proposed model is
performed on the patch matrix to recover its noise-free version. During the
recovery process, a) a weight matrix is introduced to fully utilize the noise
difference between channels; b) the singular values are shrunk adaptively
without additionally assigning weights. With them, the proposed model can
achieve promising results while keeping simplicity. To solve the proposed
model, an accurate and effective algorithm is built based on the alternating
direction method of multipliers framework. The solution of each updating step
can be analytically expressed in closed-from. Rigorous theoretical analysis
proves the solution sequences generated by the proposed algorithm converge to
their respective stationary points. Experimental results on both synthetic and

approaches were designed to be independent of the patient-specific geometries

transmural position. One method outputs ranked alternative solutions. Results
can be visualized either on a generic or patient geometry. The CNNs were
trained on a data set containing only simulated data and evaluated both on

below 3mm. The median localization error on the clinical data was as low as
32mm. The transmural position was correctly detected in up to 82% of all

dropped to 20mm on clinical data. These results demonstrate a proof of
principle to utilize CNNs to localize the activation source without the

for developing a robust learning algorithm that can learn the normal traffic

polarization, including many recent efforts that take a computational
perspective. By detecting political biases in a corpus of text, one can attempt
to describe and discern the polarity of that text. Intuitively, the named
entities (i.e., the nouns and phrases that act as nouns) and hashtags in text
often carry information about political views. For example, people who use the
term ""pro-choice"" are likely to be liberal, whereas people who use the term
""pro-life"" are likely to be conservative. In this paper, we seek to reveal
political polarities in social-media text data and to quantify these polarities
by explicitly assigning a polarity score to entities and hashtags. Although
this idea is straightforward, it is difficult to perform such inference in a
trustworthy quantitative way. Key challenges include the small number of known
labels, the continuous spectrum of political views, and the preservation of
both a polarity score and a polarity-neutral semantic meaning in an embedding
vector of words. To attempt to overcome these challenges, we propose the
Polarity-aware Embedding Multi-task learning (PEM) model. This model consists
of (1) a self-supervised context-preservation task, (2) an attention-based
tweet-level polarity-inference task, and (3) an adversarial learning task that
promotes independence between an embedding's polarity dimension and its
semantic dimensions. Our experimental results demonstrate that our PEM model
can successfully learn polarity-aware embeddings. We examine a variety of
applications and we thereby demonstrate the effectiveness of our PEM model. We
also discuss important limitations of our work and stress caution when applying
the PEM model to real-world scenarios.

industrial cooling systems, offering substantial energy savings compared to
traditional heuristic policies. A major challenge in industrial control
involves learning behaviors that are feasible in the real world due to
machinery constraints. For example, certain actions can only be executed every
few hours while other actions can be taken more frequently. Without extensive
reward engineering and experimentation, an RL agent may not learn realistic
operation of machinery. To address this, we use hierarchical reinforcement
learning with multiple agents that control subsets of actions according to
their operation time scales. Our hierarchical approach achieves energy savings
over existing baselines while maintaining constraints such as operating
chillers within safe bounds in a simulated HVAC control environment.

  with Applications to Subgraph Counting",Full version of the paper accepted to APPROX 2022,,,,cs.DS,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The $h$-index is a metric used to measure the impact of a user in a
publication setting, such as a member of a social network with many highly
liked posts or a researcher in an academic domain with many highly cited
publications. Specifically, the $h$-index of a user is the largest integer $h$
such that at least $h$ publications of the user have at least $h$ units of
positive feedback.
  We design an algorithm that, given query access to the $n$ publications of a
user and each publication's corresponding positive feedback number, outputs a
$(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of the $h$-index of this user with
probability at least $1-\delta$ in time \[
  O(\frac{n \cdot \ln{(1/\delta)}}{\varepsilon^2 \cdot h}),
  \] where $h$ is the actual $h$-index which is unknown to the algorithm
a-priori. We then design a novel lower bound technique that allows us to prove
that this bound is in fact asymptotically optimal for this problem in all
parameters $n,h,\varepsilon,$ and $\delta$.
  Our work is one of the first in sublinear time algorithms that addresses
obtaining asymptotically optimal bounds, especially in terms of the error and
confidence parameters. As such, we focus on designing novel techniques for this
task. In particular, our lower bound technique seems quite general -- to
showcase this, we also use our approach to prove an asymptotically optimal
lower bound for the problem of estimating the number of triangles in a graph in
sublinear time, which now is also optimal in the error and confidence
parameters. This result improves upon prior lower bounds of Eden, Levi, Ron,
and Seshadhri (FOCS'15) for this problem, as well as multiple follow-ups that
extended this lower bound to other subgraph counting problems.

the national electric power system. We consider two kinds of attacks: ($i$) an
attack by an adversary that uses a tactical weapon and destroys a large part of
the grid, by physically targeting a large geographic region; ($ii$) a targeted
attack by an adversary that takes out a small number of critical components in
the network simultaneously. Our analysis uses ($i$) a realistic representation
of the underlying power grid, including the topology, the control and
protection components, ($ii$) a realistic representation of the targeted attack
scenario, and ($iii$) a dynamic stability analysis, that goes beyond
traditional work comprising structural and linear flow analysis. Such realistic
analysis is expensive, but critical since it can capture cascading failures
that result from transient instabilities introduced due to the attack. Our
model acknowledges the presence of hidden failures in the protection systems
resulting in relay misoperations. We analyze the extent of cascading outages
for different levels of hidden failures. Our results show that: ($i$) the power
grid is vulnerable to both these attacks, ($ii$) the tactical attack has
significant social, economic and health damage but need not result in a
regional cascade; on the contrary the targeted attack can cause significant
cascade and lead to power outage over a large region. Our work shows the
necessity to harden the power grid not just to cyber-attacks but also to
physical attacks. Furthermore, we show that realistic representations and
analysis can lead to fundamentally new insights that simplified models are
unlikely to capture. Finally, the methods and results help us identify critical
elements in the grid; the system can then be hardened in a more precise manner
to reduce the vulnerabilities.

Deep Learning methods have been proposed for automatic tooth segmentation from
3D dental models or intraoral scans. These methods require annotated 3D
intraoral scans. Manually annotating 3D intraoral scans is a laborious task.
One approach is to devise self-supervision methods to reduce the manual
labeling effort. Compared to other types of point cloud data like scene point
cloud or shape point cloud data, 3D tooth point cloud data has a very regular
structure and a strong shape prior. We look at how much representative
information can be learnt from a single 3D intraoral scan. We evaluate this
quantitatively with the help of ten different methods of which six are generic
point cloud segmentation methods whereas the other four are tooth segmentation
specific methods. Surprisingly, we find that with a single 3D intraoral scan
training, the Dice score can be as high as 0.86 whereas the full training set
gives Dice score of 0.94. We conclude that the segmentation methods can learn a
great deal of information from a single 3D tooth point cloud scan under
suitable conditions e.g. data augmentation. We are the first to quantitatively
evaluate and demonstrate the representation learning capability of Deep
Learning methods from a single 3D intraoral scan. This can enable building
self-supervision methods for tooth segmentation under extreme data limitation
scenario by leveraging the available data to the fullest possible extent.

averaging algorithm to compute refinable vector functions for wavelet methods
in numerical PDEs and to produce smooth curves in CAGD. In sharp contrast to
the well-studied scalar subdivision schemes, vector subdivision schemes are
much less well understood, e.g., Lagrange and (generalized) Hermite subdivision
schemes are the only studied vector subdivision schemes in the literature.
Because many wavelets used in numerical PDEs are derived from refinable vector
functions whose matrix masks are not from Hermite subdivision schemes, it is
necessary to introduce and study vector subdivision schemes for any general
matrix masks in order to compute wavelets and refinable vector functions
efficiently. For a general matrix mask, we show that there is only one
meaningful way of defining a vector subdivision scheme. Motivated by vector
cascade algorithms and recent study on Hermite subdivision schemes, we shall
define a vector subdivision scheme for any arbitrary matrix mask and then we
prove that the convergence of the newly defined vector subdivision scheme is
equivalent to the convergence of its associated vector cascade algorithm. We
also study convergence rates of vector subdivision schemes. The results of this
paper not only bridge the gaps and establish intrinsic links between vector
subdivision schemes and vector cascade algorithms but also strengthen and
generalize current known results on Lagrange and (generalized) Hermite
subdivision schemes. Several examples are provided to illustrate the results in
this paper on various types of vector subdivision schemes with convergence
rates.

The few existing studies on this topic rather focus on specific attributes of
quality that can be easily quantified and measured. Existing techniques and
corresponding tools may also focus on comments bound to a specific programming
language, and may only deal with comments with specific scopes and clear goals

(iii) Which tools and techniques do they use to assess comment quality?, and
(iv) How do they evaluate their studies on comment quality assessment in

importance in many applications. A well-known strategy to design such devices
is multi-scale topology optimization (MTO), where optimal microstructures are
designed within each cell of a discretized domain. Unfortunately, MTO is
computationally very expensive since one must perform homogenization of the
evolving microstructures, during each step of the homogenization process. As an
alternate, we propose here a graded multiscale topology optimization (GMTO) for
designing fluid-flow devices. In the proposed method, several pre-selected but
size-parameterized and orientable microstructures are used to fill the domain
optimally. GMTO significantly reduces the computation while retaining many of
the benefits of MTO.
  In particular, GMTO is implemented here using a neural-network (NN) since:
(1) homogenization can be performed off-line, and used by the NN during
optimization, (2) it enables continuous switching between microstructures
during optimization, (3) the number of design variables and computational
effort is independent of number of microstructure used, and, (4) it supports
automatic differentiation, thereby eliminating manual sensitivity analysis.

  Robust Loss",,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  Recent advances in deep learning algorithms have led to significant benefits
for solving many medical image analysis problems. Training deep learning models
commonly requires large datasets with expert-labeled annotations. However,
acquiring expert-labeled annotation is not only expensive but also is
subjective, error-prone, and inter-/intra- observer variability introduces
noise to labels. This is particularly a problem when using deep learning models
for segmenting medical images due to the ambiguous anatomical boundaries.
Image-based medical diagnosis tools using deep learning models trained with
incorrect segmentation labels can lead to false diagnoses and treatment
suggestions. Multi-rater annotations might be better suited to train deep
learning models with small training sets compared to single-rater annotations.
The aim of this paper was to develop and evaluate a method to generate
probabilistic labels based on multi-rater annotations and anatomical knowledge
of the lesion features in MRI and a method to train segmentation models using
probabilistic labels using normalized active-passive loss as a ""noise-tolerant
loss"" function. The model was evaluated by comparing it to binary ground truth
for 17 knees MRI scans for clinical segmentation and detection of bone marrow
lesions (BML). The proposed method successfully improved precision 14, recall
22, and Dice score 8 percent compared to a binary cross-entropy loss function.
Overall, the results of this work suggest that the proposed normalized
active-passive loss using soft labels successfully mitigated the effects of
noisy labels.

representing the graph as the 1-skeleton of a cell complex introduced to
capture higher order interactions. In particular, we exploit the lower and
upper neighborhoods, as encoded in the cell complex, to design two independent
masked self-attention mechanisms, thus generalizing the conventional graph
attention strategy. The approach used in CANs is hierarchical and it
incorporates the following steps: i) a lifting algorithm that learns {\it edge
features} from {\it node features}; ii) a cell attention mechanism to find the
optimal combination of edge features over both lower and upper neighbors; iii)
a hierarchical {\it edge pooling} mechanism to extract a compact meaningful set
of features. The experimental results show that CAN is a low complexity
strategy that compares favorably with state of the art results on graph-based

algorithms in continuous spaces, but a similar understanding has been lacking

discrete spaces has been proved to be asymptotically optimal, but the question
of optimal scaling has remained open. In this paper, we establish, for the
first time, that the efficiency of M-H in discrete spaces can also be
characterized by an asymptotic acceptance rate that is independent of the
target distribution. Moreover, we verify, both theoretically and empirically,
that the optimal acceptance rates for LBP and random walk Metropolis (RWM) are
$0.574$ and $0.234$ respectively. These results also help establish that LBP is
asymptotically $O(N^\frac{2}{3})$ more efficient than RWM with respect to model
dimension $N$. Knowledge of the optimal acceptance rate allows one to
automatically tune the neighborhood size of a proposal distribution in a
discrete space, directly analogous to step-size control in continuous spaces.
We demonstrate empirically that such adaptive M-H sampling can robustly improve
sampling in a variety of target distributions in discrete spaces, including

dynamics and measurement models. However, this implies that the dynamics model
within these algorithms has to be sufficiently accurate in order to warrant the
accuracy of the state estimates. To enhance the dynamics models and improve the
estimation accuracy, we utilize a deep learning framework known as
knowledge-based neural ordinary differential equations (KNODEs). The KNODE
framework embeds prior knowledge into the training procedure and synthesizes an
accurate hybrid model by fusing a prior first-principles model with a neural
ordinary differential equation (NODE) model. In our proposed LEARNEST
framework, we integrate the data-driven model into two novel model-based state

algorithms are compared against their conventional counterparts across a number
of robotic applications; state estimation for a cartpole system using partial

a quadrotor. Through simulations and tests using real-world experimental data,

highly beneficial features for nonvolatile memory (NVM) design. Key advantages
of VSH-based magnetic random-access memory (VSH-MRAM) over spin orbit torque
(SOT)-MRAM include access transistor-less compact bit-cell and low power
switching of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) magnets. Nevertheless,
large device resistance in the read path (RS) due to low mobility of WSe2 and
Schottky contacts deteriorates sense margin, offsetting the benefits of
VSH-MRAM. To address this limitation, we propose another flavor of VSH-based
MRAM that (while inheriting most of the benefits of VSH-MRAM) achieves lower RS
in the read path by electrically isolating the read and write terminals. This
is enabled by coupling VSH with electrically-isolated but magnetically-coupled
PMA magnets via interlayer exchange-coupling. Designing the proposed devices
using object oriented micro magnetic framework (OOMMF) simulation, we ensure
the robustness of the exchange-coupled PMA system under process variations. To
maintain a compact memory footprint, we share the read access transistor across
multiple bit-cells. Compared to the existing VSH-MRAMs, our design achieves
39%-42% and 36%-46% reduction in read time and energy, respectively, along with
1.1X-1.3X larger sense margin at a comparable area. This comes at the cost of
1.7X and 2.0X increase in write time and energy, respectively. Thus, the
proposed design is suitable for applications in which reads are more dominant

original images and then register them using existing tools. Our main
contribution is an extensive analysis of the impact of downsampling on
registration performance. We study this impact by comparing full-resolution
registrations obtained with CLAIRE to lower-resolution registrations for
synthetic and real-world imaging datasets. Our results suggest that
registration at full resolution can yield a superior registration quality --
but not always. For example, downsampling a synthetic image from $1024^3$ to
$256^3$ decreases the Dice coefficient from 92% to 79%. However, the
differences are less pronounced for noisy or low-contrast high-resolution

Considering image patches as tokens, transformers can model the global

However, global attention is computationally expensive. As a consequence, it is
difficult to scale up these transformer-based methods to high-resolution
features and many views.
  In this paper, we propose the token-Pruned Pose Transformer (PPT) for 2D

self-attention only within selected tokens. Furthermore, we extend our PPT to
multi-view human pose estimation. Built upon PPT, we propose a new cross-view
fusion strategy, called human area fusion, which considers all human foreground
pixels as corresponding candidates. Experimental results on COCO and MPII
demonstrate that our PPT can match the accuracy of previous pose transformer

selection over the two generators allows the adapter to take into account
solely the task-relevant parts in sequence generation, and therefore makes it
more robust to overfitting as well as more stable in RL training. In addition,
to obtain the complementary adapter from the PLM for each few-shot task, we
exploit a separate selecting module that is also simultaneously trained using
RL. Experimental results on various few-shot NLG tasks including question
answering, data-to-text generation and text summarization demonstrate that the
proposed selective token generation significantly outperforms the previous
additive learning algorithms based on the PLMs.

datasets that contain offensive texts and their inoffensive counterparts, and
fine-tuning pretrained models with limited labeled data can lead to the loss of
original meaning in the style-transferred text. To address this issue, we
provide two major contributions. First, we release the first
publicly-available, parallel corpus of offensive Reddit comments and their
style-transferred counterparts annotated by expert sociolinguists. Then, we
introduce the first discourse-aware style-transfer models that can effectively
reduce offensiveness in Reddit text while preserving the meaning of the
original text. These models are the first to examine inferential links between
the comment and the text it is replying to when transferring the style of
offensive Reddit text. We propose two different methods of integrating
discourse relations with pretrained transformer models and evaluate them on our
dataset of offensive comments from Reddit and their inoffensive counterparts.
Improvements over the baseline with respect to both automatic metrics and human
evaluation indicate that our discourse-aware models are better at preserving
meaning in style-transferred text when compared to the state-of-the-art
discourse-agnostic models.

methods, where the critical bottleneck is identified as how to fulfill the
high-frequency structure and low-frequency texture information on the masked
regions with semantics. To this end, deep models exhibit powerful superiority
to capture them, yet constrained on the local spatial regions. In this paper,
we delve globally into texture and structure information to well capture the
semantics for image inpainting. As opposed to the existing arts trapped on the
independent local patches, the texture information of each patch is
reconstructed from all other patches across the whole image, to match the
coarsely filled information, specially the structure information over the
masked regions. Unlike the current decoder-only transformer within the pixel
level for image inpainting, our model adopts the transformer pipeline paired
with both encoder and decoder. On one hand, the encoder captures the texture
semantic correlations of all patches across image via self-attention module. On
the other hand, an adaptive patch vocabulary is dynamically established in the
decoder for the filled patches over the masked regions. Building on this, a
structure-texture matching attention module anchored on the known regions comes
up to marry the best of these two worlds for progressive inpainting via a
probabilistic diffusion process. Our model is orthogonal to the fashionable
arts, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Attention and Transformer
model, from the perspective of texture and structure information for image
inpainting. The extensive experiments over the benchmarks validate its
superiority. Our code is available at

$T$ traverses $e$. The problem is known to be NP-hard, but its approximability
is still poorly understood, and it is not even known whether the optimum can be
efficiently approximated with ratio $o(n)$. In the decision version of this
problem, denoted STC-$K$, we need to determine if $G$ has a spanning tree with
congestion at most $K$. It is known that STC-$K$ is NP-complete for $K\ge 8$,
and this implies a lower bound of $1.125$ on the approximation ratio of
minimizing congestion. On the other hand, $3$-STC can be solved in polynomial
time, with the complexity status of this problem for $K\in \{4,5,6,7\}$
remaining an open problem. We substantially improve the earlier hardness result
by proving that STC-$K$ is NP-complete for $K\ge 5$. This leaves only the case
$K=4$ open, and improves the lower bound on the approximation ratio to $1.2$.

achieving these properties include the generalized Ohm's law for electric field
such that the asymptotic-preserving discretization can be achieved, and a
proper decomposition of the effects of the electromagnetic fields such that a
Lagrange multiplier method can be appropriately employed for correcting the

achieved promising results on some evaluation metrics (e.g., CIDEr). However,
recent findings show that the captions generated by these methods tend to be
biased toward the ""average"" caption that only captures the most general mode
(a.k.a, language pattern) in the training corpus, i.e., the so-called mode
collapse problem. Affected by it, the generated captions are limited in
diversity and usually less informative than natural image descriptions made by
humans. In this paper, we seek to avoid this problem by proposing a Discrete
Mode Learning (DML) paradigm for image captioning. Our innovative idea is to
explore the rich modes in the training caption corpus to learn a set of ""mode
embeddings"", and further use them to control the mode of the generated captions
for existing image captioning models. Specifically, the proposed DML optimizes
a dual architecture that consists of an image-conditioned discrete variational
autoencoder (CdVAE) branch and a mode-conditioned image captioning (MIC)
branch. The CdVAE branch maps each image caption to one of the mode embeddings
stored in a learned codebook, and is trained with a pure non-autoregressive
generation objective to make the modes distinct and representative. The MIC
branch can be simply modified from an existing image captioning model, where
the mode embedding is added to the original word embeddings as the control
signal. In the experiments, we apply the proposed DML to two widely used image
captioning models, Transformer and AoANet. The results show that the learned
mode embedding successfully facilitates these models to generate high-quality
image captions with different modes, further leading to better performance for
both diversity and quality on the MSCOCO dataset.

  Wang, Yi Fang","Understanding the Impact of Image Quality and Distance of Objects to
  Object Detection Performance",,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Deep learning has made great strides for object detection in images. The
detection accuracy and computational cost of object detection depend on the
spatial resolution of an image, which may be constrained by both the camera and
storage considerations. Compression is often achieved by reducing either
spatial or amplitude resolution or, at times, both, both of which have
well-known effects on performance. Detection accuracy also depends on the
distance of the object of interest from the camera. Our work examines the
impact of spatial and amplitude resolution, as well as object distance, on
object detection accuracy and computational cost. We develop a
resolution-adaptive variant of YOLOv5 (RA-YOLO), which varies the number of
scales in the feature pyramid and detection head based on the spatial
resolution of the input image. To train and evaluate this new method, we
created a dataset of images with diverse spatial and amplitude resolutions by
combining images from the TJU and Eurocity datasets and generating different
resolutions by applying spatial resizing and compression. We first show that
RA-YOLO achieves a good trade-off between detection accuracy and inference time
over a large range of spatial resolutions. We then evaluate the impact of
spatial and amplitude resolutions on object detection accuracy using the
proposed RA-YOLO model. We demonstrate that the optimal spatial resolution that
leads to the highest detection accuracy depends on the 'tolerated' image size.
We further assess the impact of the distance of an object to the camera on the
detection accuracy and show that higher spatial resolution enables a greater
detection range. These results provide important guidelines for choosing the
image spatial resolution and compression settings predicated on available
bandwidth, storage, desired inference time, and/or desired detection range, in
practical applications.

propose to restore HSIs in a unified approach with an effective plug-and-play
method, which can jointly retain the flexibility of optimization-based methods
and utilize the powerful representation capability of deep neural networks.
Specifically, we first develop a new deep HSI denoiser leveraging gated
recurrent convolution units, short- and long-term skip connections, and an
augmented noise level map to better exploit the abundant spatio-spectral
information within HSIs. It, therefore, leads to the state-of-the-art
performance on HSI denoising under both Gaussian and complex noise settings.
Then, the proposed denoiser is inserted into the plug-and-play framework as a
powerful implicit HSI prior to tackle various HSI restoration tasks. Through
extensive experiments on HSI super-resolution, compressed sensing, and
inpainting, we demonstrate that our approach often achieves superior
performance, which is competitive with or even better than the state-of-the-art
on each task, via a single model without any task-specific training.

planning, it is desirable for SLAM pipelines to generate lightweight geometric
map representations. Such representations are also particularly well-suited for
man-made environments, which can often be viewed as a so-called ""Manhattan

on a grouping-based approach that groups points to obtain object instances.
Despite improvement in producing accurate segmentation results, these methods
lack scalability and commonly require dividing large input into multiple parts.
To process a scene with millions of points, the existing fastest method
SoftGroup \cite{vu2022softgroup} requires tens of seconds, which is under
satisfaction. Our finding is that $k$-Nearest Neighbor ($k$-NN), which serves
as the prerequisite of grouping, is a computational bottleneck. This bottleneck
severely worsens the inference time in the scene with a large number of points.
This paper proposes SoftGroup++ to address this computational bottleneck and
further optimize the inference speed of the whole network. SoftGroup++ is built
upon SoftGroup, which differs in three important aspects: (1) performs octree
$k$-NN instead of vanilla $k$-NN to reduce time complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$, (2) performs pyramid scaling
that adaptively downsamples backbone outputs to reduce search space for $k$-NN
and grouping, and (3) performs late devoxelization that delays the conversion
from voxels to points towards the end of the model such that intermediate
components operate at a low computational cost. Extensive experiments on
various indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
SoftGroup++. Notably, SoftGroup++ processes large scenes of millions of points
by a single forward without dividing the input into multiple parts, thus
enriching contextual information. Especially, SoftGroup++ achieves 2.4 points

Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) standard to reduce attribute compression
artifacts. The proposed method first generates multiple Most-Probable Sample
Offsets (MPSOs) as potential compression distortion approximations, and then
linearly weights them for artifact mitigation. As such, we drive the filtered
reconstruction as close to the uncompressed PCA as possible. To this end, we
devise a Compression Artifact Reduction Network (CARNet) which consists of two
consecutive processing phases: MPSOs derivation and MPSOs combination. The
MPSOs derivation uses a two-stream network to model local neighborhood
variations from direct spatial embedding and frequency-dependent embedding,
where sparse convolutions are utilized to best aggregate information from
sparsely and irregularly distributed points. The MPSOs combination is guided by
the least square error metric to derive weighting coefficients on the fly to
further capture content dynamics of input PCAs. The CARNet is implemented as an
in-loop filtering tool of the GPCC, where those linear weighting coefficients
are encapsulated into the bitstream with negligible bit rate overhead.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement over the latest GPCC
both subjectively and objectively.

explicit representation and implicit representation. Unlike explicit
representation that represents light fields as Sub-Aperture Images (SAIs) based
arrays or Micro-Images (MIs) based lenslet images, implicit representation
treats light fields as neural networks, which is inherently a continuous
representation in contrast to discrete explicit representation. However, at
present almost all the implicit representations for light fields utilize SAIs
to train an MLP to learn a pixel-wise mapping from 4D spatial-angular
coordinate to pixel colors, which is neither compact nor of low complexity.
Instead, in this paper we propose MiNL, a novel MI-wise implicit neural
representation for light fields that train an MLP + CNN to learn a mapping from
2D MI coordinates to MI colors. Given the micro-image's coordinate, MiNL
outputs the corresponding micro-image's RGB values. Light field encoding in
MiNL is just training a neural network to regress the micro-images and the
decoding process is a simple feedforward operation. Compared with common
pixel-wise implicit representation, MiNL is more compact and efficient that has
faster decoding speed (\textbf{$\times$80$\sim$180} speed-up) as well as better
visual quality (\textbf{1$\sim$4dB} PSNR improvement on average).

(LRA) has gained increasing attention. Recently, Bartlett, Indyk, and Wagner
(COLT 2022) presented a generalization bound for the learning-based LRA.
Specifically, for rank-$k$ approximation using an $m \times n$ learned
sketching matrix with $s$ non-zeros in each column, they proved an
$\tilde{\mathrm{O}}(nsm)$ bound on the \emph{fat shattering dimension}
($\tilde{\mathrm{O}}$ hides logarithmic factors). We build on their work and
make two contributions.
  1. We present a better $\tilde{\mathrm{O}}(nsk)$ bound ($k \le m$). En route
to obtaining the bound, we give a low-complexity \emph{Goldberg--Jerrum
algorithm} for computing pseudo-inverse matrices, which would be of independent
interest.
  2. We alleviate an assumption of the previous study that the sparsity pattern
of sketching matrices is fixed. We prove that learning positions of non-zeros
increases the fat shattering dimension only by ${\mathrm{O}}(ns\log n)$. Also,
experiments confirm the practical benefit of learning sparsity patterns.

tackle this challenge, we propose Folded Rationalization (FR) that folds the
two phases of the rationale model into one from the perspective of text
semantic extraction. The key idea of FR is to employ a unified encoder between
the generator and predictor, based on which FR can facilitate a better
predictor by access to valuable information blocked by the generator in the
traditional two-phase model and thus bring a better generator. Empirically, we
show that FR improves the F1 score by up to 10.3% as compared to

This paper focuses on toponym disambiguation, which is usually approached by

considerable attention. However, very few researches address the issue of
emotional editing of these talking face videos with continuously controllable
expressions, which is a strong demand in the industry. The challenge is that
speech-related expressions and emotion-related expressions are often highly
coupled. Meanwhile, traditional image-to-image translation methods cannot work
well in our application due to the coupling of expressions with other
attributes such as poses, i.e., translating the expression of the character in
each frame may simultaneously change the head pose due to the bias of the
training data distribution. In this paper, we propose a high-quality facial
expression editing method for talking face videos, allowing the user to control
the target emotion in the edited video continuously. We present a new
perspective for this task as a special case of motion information editing,
where we use a 3DMM to capture major facial movements and an associated texture
map modeled by a StyleGAN to capture appearance details. Both representations
(3DMM and texture map) contain emotional information and can be continuously
modified by neural networks and easily smoothed by averaging in
coefficient/latent spaces, making our method simple yet effective. We also
introduce a mouth shape preservation loss to control the trade-off between lip
synchronization and the degree of exaggeration of the edited expression.
Extensive experiments and a user study show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various evaluation criteria.

the conductivity tensor $\mathbb{C}$ and the pressure $p$. We use finite
differences schemes in a uniform Cartesian grid in the spatially
two-dimensional setting to solve the two systems, where the parabolic equation
is solved by a semi-implicit scheme in time. Since the conductivity vector and
tensor appear also in the Poisson equation for the pressure $p$, the elliptic

three linear systems in the case of the conductivity vector $m\in\mathbb{R}^2$,

problem by treating the classes differently, formulated typically via a
user-defined fixed misclassification cost matrix provided as input to the
learner. Such parameter tuning is a challenging task that requires domain
knowledge and moreover, wrong adjustments might lead to overall predictive
performance deterioration. In this work, we propose a novel cost-sensitive
boosting approach for imbalanced data that dynamically adjusts the
misclassification costs over the boosting rounds in response to model's
performance instead of using a fixed misclassification cost matrix. Our method,

boosting round and comes with theoretical guarantees regarding the training

of deep networks. By constructing classifiers with varying resource demands
(the exits), such networks allow easy samples to be output at early exits,
removing the need for executing deeper layers. While existing works mainly
focus on the architectural design of multi-exit networks, the training
strategies for such models are largely left unexplored. The current
state-of-the-art models treat all samples the same during training. However,
the early-exiting behavior during testing has been ignored, leading to a gap
between training and testing. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by
sample weighting. Intuitively, easy samples, which generally exit early in the
network during inference, should contribute more to training early classifiers.
The training of hard samples (mostly exit from deeper layers), however, should
be emphasized by the late classifiers. Our work proposes to adopt a weight
prediction network to weight the loss of different training samples at each
exit. This weight prediction network and the backbone model are jointly
optimized under a meta-learning framework with a novel optimization objective.
By bringing the adaptive behavior during inference into the training phase, we
show that the proposed weighting mechanism consistently improves the trade-off

k. We develop a graph neural network architecture that utilizes De Bruijn
graphs to implement a message passing scheme that follows a non-Markovian
dynamics, which enables us to learn patterns in the causal topology of a
dynamic graph. Addressing the issue that De Bruijn graphs with different orders
k can be used to model the same data set, we further apply statistical model
selection to determine the optimal graph topology to be used for message
passing. An evaluation in synthetic and empirical data sets suggests that
DBGNNs can leverage temporal patterns in dynamic graphs, which substantially
improves the performance in a supervised node classification task.

academic and industrial applications, and such algorithms are, accordingly,
becoming common components in computer science curricula. Learning ML is
challenging not only due to its complex mathematical and algorithmic aspects,
but also due to a) the complexity of using correctly these algorithms in the
context of real-life situations and b) the understanding of related social and
ethical issues. Cognitive biases are phenomena of the human brain that may
cause erroneous perceptions and irrational decision-making processes. As such,
they have been researched thoroughly in the context of cognitive psychology and
decision making; they do, however, have important implications for computer
science education as well. One well-known cognitive bias, first described by
Kahneman and Tversky, is the base rate neglect bias, according to which humans
fail to consider the base rate of the underlaying phenomena when evaluating
conditional probabilities. In this paper, we explore the expression of the base
rate neglect bias in ML education. Specifically, we show that about one third
of students in an Introduction to ML course, from varied backgrounds (computer
science students and teachers, data science, engineering, social science and
digital humanities), fail to correctly evaluate ML algorithm performance due to
the base rate neglect bias. This failure rate should alert educators and
promote the development of new pedagogical methods for teaching ML algorithm
performance.

Individual Discriminatory Instances (IDIs).
  In this paper, we propose an approach for the selection of the initial seeds

initial seeds to this end. However this phase is crucial, as these seeds are
the basis of the follow-up IDIs generation. We dubbed our proposed seed
selection approach I&D. It generates a large number of initial IDIs exhibiting
a great diversity, aiming at improving the overall performance of fairness
testing.
  Our empirical study reveal that I&D is able to produce a larger number of
IDIs with respect to four state-of-the-art seed generation approaches,
generating 1.68X more IDIs on average. Moreover, we compare the use of I&D to
train machine learning models and find that using I&D reduces the number of
remaining IDIs by 29% when compared to the state-of-the-art, thus indicating
that I&D is effective for improving model fairness

achieving safe autonomous driving. Despite plausible results of deep learning
methods, most existing approaches are only frame-based and may fail to reach
reasonable performance when dealing with dynamic traffic participants. Recent
advances in sensor technologies, especially the Event camera, can naturally
complement the conventional camera approach to better model moving objects.
However, event-based works often adopt a pre-defined time window for event
representation, and simply integrate it to estimate image intensities from
events, neglecting much of the rich temporal information from the available
asynchronous events. Therefore, from a new perspective, we propose RENet, a
novel RGB-Event fusion Network, that jointly exploits the two complementary
modalities to achieve more robust MOD under challenging scenarios for
autonomous driving. Specifically, we first design a temporal multi-scale
aggregation module to fully leverage event frames from both the RGB exposure
time and larger intervals. Then we introduce a bi-directional fusion module to
attentively calibrate and fuse multi-modal features. To evaluate the
performance of our network, we carefully select and annotate a sub-MOD dataset
from the commonly used DSEC dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art
RGB-Event fusion alternatives.

we use sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) to extend the capacity of a
conformer block without increasing computation. Then, the parameters of the
grouped conformer blocks are shared so that the number of parameters is
reduced. Next, to ensure the shared blocks with the flexibility of adapting
representations at different levels, we design the MoE routers and
normalization individually. Moreover, we use knowledge distillation to further
improve the performance. Experimental results show that the proposed model
achieves competitive performance with 1/3 of the parameters of the encoder,

Model Predictive Controller (MPC) on an Edge Computing device, for controlling

requires more computation power in comparison to other controllers, such as PID
or LQR, since it use cost functions, optimization methods and iteratively
predicts the output of the system and the control commands for some determined
steps in the future (prediction horizon). Thus, the computation power required
depends on the prediction horizon, the complexity of the cost functions and the
optimization. The more steps determined for the horizon the more efficient the
controller can be, but also more computation power is required. Since sometimes
robots are not capable of managing all the computing process locally, it is
important to offload some of the computing process from the robot to the cloud.
But then some disadvantages may occur, such as latency and safety issues. Cloud
computing may offer ""infinity"" computation power but the whole system suffers
in latency. A solution to this is the use of Edge Computing, which will reduce
time delays since the Edge device is much closer to the source of data.
Moreover, by using the Edge we can offload the demanding controller from the
UAV and set a longer prediction horizon and try to get a more efficient

combining points and objects is of great interest to address the problem of

relocalization ability of a SLAM system using high-level object landmarks; (2)
we build an automatic system, capable of identifying, tracking and

recovery, which we think, can significantly benefit to the AR community. Our

completion process is then formulated as a point displacement optimization
problem. Points are initialized at the partial scan and then moved to their
goal locations with two types of movements for each point: directional
movements along the light rays and constrained local movement for shape
refinement. We design neural networks to predict the ideal point movements to

the software development processes include prototyping, iterative development,
incremental development, risk-driven development, phase planning, and phase
retrospection. These results would be useful to method engineers who seek to
design high-quality software development methods as these practices serve as

rectangular safety region to represent states and detect collisions for
rectangular-shaped robots, and a carefully crafted reward function for
reinforcement learning that does not require the destination information. Then
we benchmark five reinforcement learning algorithms including DDPG, DQN, SAC,

Here we present a quantum repeating switch for CV quantum encodings that caters
to multiple communication flows. The architecture of the switch is based on
quantum light sources, detectors, memories, and switching fabric, and the

traditional methods, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) solves the
problem of flocking control more flexibly. However, methods based on MARL
suffer from sample inefficiency, since they require a huge number of
experiences to be collected from interactions between agents and the
environment. We propose a novel method Pretraining with Demonstrations for MARL
(PwD-MARL), which can utilize non-expert demonstrations collected in advance
with traditional methods to pretrain agents. During the process of pretraining,
agents learn policies from demonstrations by MARL and behavior cloning
simultaneously, and are prevented from overfitting demonstrations. By
pretraining with non-expert demonstrations, PwD-MARL improves sample efficiency
in the process of online MARL with a warm start. Experiments show that PwD-MARL
improves sample efficiency and policy performance in the problem of flocking

This model describes the biological chemotaxis phenomenon in the fluid

to a gravitational force, which is proportional to the relative surplus of the
cell density compared to the water density.
  We develop a new positivity preserving and high-resolution method for the
studied chemotaxis-fluid system. Our method is based on the diffuse-domain
approach, which we use to derive a new chemotaxis-fluid diffuse-domain (cf-DD)
model for simulating bioconvection in complex geometries. The drop domain is
imbedded into a larger rectangular domain, and the original boundary is
replaced by a diffuse interface with finite thickness. The original
chemotaxis-fluid system is reformulated on the larger domain with additional
source terms that approximate the boundary conditions on the physical

asymptotically as the width of the diffuse interface shrinks to zero. We
numerically solve the resulting cf-DD system by a second-order hybrid
finite-volume finite-difference method and demonstrate the performance of the
proposed approach on a number of numerical experiments that showcase several
interesting chemotactic phenomena in sessile drops of different shapes, where
the bacterial patterns depend on the droplet geometries.

question and answer pairs over code involving complex concepts and long chains
of reasoning. We bridge this gap by building a new, curated dataset called
CodeQueries, and proposing a neural question-answering methodology over code.
  We build upon state-of-the-art pre-trained models of code to predict answer
and supporting-fact spans. Given a query and code, only some of the code may be

2209.08383,Joe Zimmerman,Joe Zimmerman,Practical LR Parser Generation,,,,,cs.FL cs.PL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  Parsing is a fundamental building block in modern compilers, and for
industrial programming languages, it is a surprisingly involved task. There are
known approaches to generate parsers automatically, but the prevailing
consensus is that automatic parser generation is not practical for real
programming languages: LR/LALR parsers are considered to be far too restrictive
in the grammars they support, and LR parsers are often considered too
inefficient in practice. As a result, virtually all modern languages use
recursive-descent parsers written by hand, a lengthy and error-prone process
that dramatically increases the barrier to new programming language
development.
  In this work we demonstrate that, contrary to the prevailing consensus, we
can have the best of both worlds: for a very general, practical class of
grammars -- a strict superset of Knuth's canonical LR -- we can generate
parsers automatically, and the resulting parser code, as well as the generation
procedure itself, is highly efficient. This advance relies on several new
ideas, including novel automata optimization procedures; a new grammar
transformation (""CPS""); per-symbol attributes; recursive-descent actions; and
an extension of canonical LR parsing, which we refer to as XLR, which endows

Existing automated kitting systems adhere to scripted instructions and

baseline approaches of using kits defined by rigid task segmentation boundaries
defined by the task graph itself or a single kit that includes all parts

In this paper, we developed Spatial-Temporal Deep Embedding (STDE) model that
imposes parity constraints at both pixel and instance levels to generate
instance-aware embeddings for vehicle stripe segmentation on STMap. At pixel
level, each pixel was encoded with its 8-neighbor pixels at different ranges,
and this encoding is subsequently used to guide a neural network to learn the
embedding mechanism. At the instance level, a discriminative loss function is
designed to pull pixels belonging to the same instance closer and separate the
mean value of different instances far apart in the embedding space. The output
of the spatial-temporal affinity is then optimized by the mutex-watershed
algorithm to obtain final clustering results. Based on segmentation metrics,
our model outperformed five other baselines that have been used for STMap
processing and shows robustness under the influence of shadows, static noises,

margin. While new technologies, such as image segmentation, have been paramount
to improved detection and earlier diagnoses, there are still significant
challenges in treating the disease. In particular, despite an increased number
of curative resections, many postoperative patients still develop recurrent
lesions. Consequently, there is a significant need for prognostic tools that
can more accurately predict a patient's risk for recurrence.
  In this paper, we explore the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for
the segmentation and recurrence risk prediction of lung tumors that are present
in preoperative computed tomography (CT) images. First, expanding upon recent
progress in medical image segmentation, a residual U-Net is used to localize
and characterize each nodule. Then, the identified tumors are passed to a
second CNN for recurrence risk prediction. The system's final results are
produced with a random forest classifier that synthesizes the predictions of
the second network with clinical attributes. The segmentation stage uses the
LIDC-IDRI dataset and achieves a dice score of 70.3%. The recurrence risk stage
uses the NLST dataset from the National Cancer institute and achieves an AUC of
73.0%. Our proposed framework demonstrates that first, automated nodule
segmentation methods can generalize to enable pipelines for a wide range of
multitask systems and second, that deep learning and image processing have the
potential to improve current prognostic tools. To the best of our knowledge, it
is the first fully automated segmentation and recurrence risk prediction
system.

  Networks",Accepted at NeurIPS 2022,,,,cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In this paper, we advocate for two stages in a neural network's decision
making process. The first is the existing feed-forward inference framework
where patterns in given data are sensed and associated with previously learned
patterns. The second stage is a slower reflection stage where we ask the
network to reflect on its feed-forward decision by considering and evaluating
all available choices. Together, we term the two stages as introspective
learning. We use gradients of trained neural networks as a measurement of this
reflection. A simple three-layered Multi Layer Perceptron is used as the second
stage that predicts based on all extracted gradient features. We perceptually
visualize the post-hoc explanations from both stages to provide a visual
grounding to introspection. For the application of recognition, we show that an
introspective network is 4% more robust and 42% less prone to calibration
errors when generalizing to noisy data. We also illustrate the value of
introspective networks in downstream tasks that require generalizability and
calibration including active learning, out-of-distribution detection, and
uncertainty estimation. Finally, we ground the proposed machine introspection
to human introspection for the application of image quality assessment.

locate a $(d - 1)$-dimensional hyperplane $H$ whose location is unknown. The
only way that the cow can find $H$ is to roam $\mathbb{R}^d$ until it
intersects $\mathcal{H}$. If the cow travels a total distance $s$ to locate a
hyperplane $H$ whose distance from the origin was $r \ge 1$, then the cow is
said to achieve competitive ratio $s / r$.
  It is a classic result that, in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the optimal (deterministic)
competitive ratio is $9$. In $\mathbb{R}^3$, the optimal competitive ratio is
known to be at most $\approx 13.811$. But in higher dimensions, the asymptotic
relationship between $d$ and the optimal competitive ratio remains an open
question. The best upper and lower bounds, due to Antoniadis et al., are
$O(d^{3/2})$ and $\Omega(d)$, leaving a gap of roughly $\sqrt{d}$. In this
note, we achieve a stronger lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(d^{3/2})$.

contextual bandits have shown promising results to enable consistent
improvements in conversational AI systems. However, directly targeting such

making abrupt policy changes that break the current user experience. In this
study, we introduce a scalable framework for supporting fine-grained
exploration targets for individual domains via user-defined constraints. For
example, we may want to ensure fewer policy deviations in business-critical
domains such as shopping, while allocating more exploration budget to domains
such as music. Furthermore, we present a novel meta-gradient learning approach
that is scalable and practical to address this problem. The proposed method
adjusts constraint violation penalty terms adaptively through a meta objective
that encourages balanced constraint satisfaction across domains. We conduct
extensive experiments using data from a real-world conversational AI on a set
of realistic constraint benchmarks. Based on the experimental results, we
demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of achieving the best balance
between the policy value and constraint satisfaction rate.

between camera ego-motion and motion segmentation and show that both can be
jointly refined in a single learning-based framework. In particular, we present
DytanVO, the first supervised learning-based VO method that deals with dynamic
environments. It takes two consecutive monocular frames in real-time and
predicts camera ego-motion in an iterative fashion. Our method achieves an
average improvement of 27.7% in ATE over state-of-the-art VO solutions in
real-world dynamic environments, and even performs competitively among dynamic
visual SLAM systems which optimize the trajectory on the backend. Experiments
on plentiful unseen environments also demonstrate our method's

might perform on the new data is an important step toward reliable ML
applications. This is very challenging, however, as the data distribution can
change in flexible ways, and we may not have any labels on the new data, which
is often the case in monitoring settings. In this paper, we propose a new
distribution shift model, Sparse Joint Shift (SJS), which considers the joint
shift of both labels and a few features. This unifies and generalizes several
existing shift models including label shift and sparse covariate shift, where
only marginal feature or label distribution shifts are considered. We describe
mathematical conditions under which SJS is identifiable. We further propose
SEES, an algorithmic framework to characterize the distribution shift under SJS
and to estimate a model's performance on new data without any labels. We
conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets with various ML
models. Across different datasets and distribution shifts, SEES achieves
significant (up to an order of magnitude) shift estimation error improvements

have dramatically simplified ML adoption in many applications. Numerous
companies and academics pay to use ML APIs for tasks such as object detection,
OCR and sentiment analysis. Different ML APIs tackling the same task can have
very heterogeneous performance. Moreover, the ML models underlying the APIs
also evolve over time. As ML APIs rapidly become a valuable marketplace and a
widespread way to consume machine learning, it is critical to systematically
study and compare different APIs with each other and to characterize how APIs
change over time. However, this topic is currently underexplored due to the
lack of data. In this paper, we present HAPI (History of APIs), a longitudinal
dataset of 1,761,417 instances of commercial ML API applications (involving
APIs from Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft and other providers) across diverse
tasks including image tagging, speech recognition and text mining from 2020 to
2022. Each instance consists of a query input for an API (e.g., an image or
text) along with the API's output prediction/annotation and confidence scores.
HAPI is the first large-scale dataset of ML API usages and is a unique resource
for studying ML-as-a-service (MLaaS). As examples of the types of analyses that
HAPI enables, we show that ML APIs' performance change substantially over
time--several APIs' accuracies dropped on specific benchmark datasets. Even
when the API's aggregate performance stays steady, its error modes can shift
across different subtypes of data between 2020 and 2022. Such changes can
substantially impact the entire analytics pipelines that use some ML API as a
component. We further use HAPI to study commercial APIs' performance
disparities across demographic subgroups over time. HAPI can stimulate more
research in the growing field of MLaaS.

Moreover, each complete dynamic facial expression in its corresponding long

promising solution to achieve time-aware personalized modeling. It aims to
infer the next interacted item of given user based on history item sequence.
Some recent works tend to improve the sequential recommendation via randomly
masking on the history item so as to generate self-supervised signals. But such
approach will indeed result in sparser item sequence and unreliable signals.
Besides, the existing sequential recommendation is only user-centric, i.e.,
based on the historical items by chronological order to predict the probability
of candidate items, which ignores whether the items from a provider can be
successfully recommended. The such user-centric recommendation will make it
impossible for the provider to expose their new items and result in popular
bias.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Dual Contrastive Network (DCN) to generate
ground-truth self-supervised signals for sequential recommendation by auxiliary
user-sequence from item-centric perspective. Specifically, we propose dual
representation contrastive learning to refine the representation learning by
minimizing the euclidean distance between the representations of given
user/item and history items/users of them. Before the second contrastive
learning module, we perform next user prediction to to capture the trends of
items preferred by certain types of users and provide personalized exploration
opportunities for item providers. Finally, we further propose dual interest
contrastive learning to self-supervise the dynamic interest from next item/user
prediction and static interest of matching probability. Experiments on four
benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. Further
ablation study also illustrates the boosting effect of the proposed components
upon different sequential models.

this paper proposes a deep learning (DL)-based rate-splitting multiple access

we first propose a hybrid data-model driven DL-based RSMA precoding scheme,
including the passive precoding at the RIS as well as the analog active
precoding and the RSMA digital active precoding at the base station (BS). To
realize the passive precoding at the RIS, we propose a Transformer-based
data-driven RIS reflecting network (RRN). As for the analog active precoding at
the BS, we propose a match-filter based analog precoding scheme considering
that the BS and RIS adopt the LoS-MIMO antenna array architecture. As for the
RSMA digital active precoding at the BS, we propose a low-complexity
approximate weighted minimum mean square error (AWMMSE) digital precoding
scheme. Furthermore, for better precoding performance as well as lower
computational complexity, a model-driven deep unfolding active precoding
network (DFAPN) is also designed by combining the proposed AWMMSE scheme with
DL. Then, to acquire accurate CSI at the BS for the investigated RSMA precoding
scheme to achieve higher spectral efficiency, we propose a CSI acquisition
network (CAN) with low pilot and feedback signaling overhead, where the
downlink pilot transmission, CSI feedback at the user equipments (UEs), and CSI
reconstruction at the BS are modeled as an end-to-end neural network based on
Transformer.

  from a Stereo Camera Using Deep Neural Networks",,,,,cs.RO cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Obstacle detection is a safety-critical problem in robot navigation, where
stereo matching is a popular vision-based approach. While deep neural networks
have shown impressive results in computer vision, most of the previous obstacle
detection works only leverage traditional stereo matching techniques to meet
the computational constraints for real-time feedback. This paper proposes a
computationally efficient method that leverages a deep neural network to detect
occupancy from stereo images directly. Instead of learning the point cloud
correspondence from the stereo data, our approach extracts the compact obstacle
distribution based on volumetric representations. In addition, we prune the
computation of safety irrelevant spaces in a coarse-to-fine manner based on
octrees generated by the decoder. As a result, we achieve real-time performance
on the onboard computer (NVIDIA Jetson TX2). Our approach detects obstacles
accurately in the range of 32 meters and achieves better IoU (Intersection over
Union) and CD (Chamfer Distance) scores with only 2% of the computation cost of
the state-of-the-art stereo model. Furthermore, we validate our method's
robustness and real-world feasibility through autonomous navigation experiments
with a real robot. Hence, our work contributes toward closing the gap between
the stereo-based system in robot perception and state-of-the-art stereo models
in computer vision. To counter the scarcity of high-quality real-world indoor
stereo datasets, we collect a 1.36 hours stereo dataset with a Jackal robot
which is used to fine-tune our model. The dataset, the code, and more
visualizations are available at https://lhy.xyz/stereovoxelnet/

in kernel approximation for scalability of kernel methods. The theoretical
foundation of RFFs is based on the Bochner theorem that relates symmetric,
positive definite (PD) functions to probability measures. This condition
naturally excludes asymmetric functions with a wide range applications in
practice, e.g., directed graphs, conditional probability, and asymmetric
kernels. Nevertheless, understanding asymmetric functions (kernels) and its
scalability via RFFs is unclear both theoretically and empirically. In this
paper, we introduce a complex measure with the real and imaginary parts
corresponding to four finite positive measures, which expands the application
scope of the Bochner theorem. By doing so, this framework allows for handling
classical symmetric, PD kernels via one positive measure; symmetric,
non-positive definite kernels via signed measures; and asymmetric kernels via
complex measures, thereby unifying them into a general framework by RFFs, named
AsK-RFFs. Such approximation scheme via complex measures enjoys theoretical
guarantees in the perspective of the uniform convergence. In algorithmic
implementation, to speed up the kernel approximation process, which is
expensive due to the calculation of total mass, we employ a subset-based fast
estimation method that optimizes total masses on a sub-training set, which
enjoys computational efficiency in high dimensions. Our AsK-RFFs method is
empirically validated on several typical large-scale datasets and achieves
promising kernel approximation performance, which demonstrate the effectiveness
of AsK-RFFs.

symptomatic of distributed consensus, spurring wide interest in analyzing and
resolving it. The state-of-the-art works can be categorized into two kinds:
experiment-based and model-based. However, the former falls short in
exclusiveness since the derived observations are scenario-specific. Hence, it
is problematic to abstractly reveal the crystal-clear forking laws. Besides,
the models established in the latter are spatiality-free, which totally
overlook the fact that forking is essentially an undesirable result under a
given topology. Moreover, few of the ongoing studies have yielded to the active
defense mechanisms but only recognized forking passively, which impedes forking
prevention and cannot deter it at the source. In this paper, we fill the gap by
carrying out the active defense analysis of blockchain forking from the
spatial-temporal dimension. Our work is featured by the following two traits:
1) dual dimensions. We consider the spatiality of blockchain overlay network
besides temporal characteristics, based on which, a spatial-temporal model for
information propagation in blockchain is proposed; 2) active defense. We hint
that shrinking the long-range link factor, which indicates the remote
connection ability of a link, can cut down forking completely fundamentally. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to inspect forking from the
spatial-temporal perspective, so as to present countermeasures proactively.
Solid theoretical derivations and extensive simulations are conducted to
justify the validity and effectiveness of our analysis.

explore to minimize the uncertainties in both semantic (object classification)
and geometric (object modeling) information. We represent the environment using
informative but sparse object models, each consisting of a basic shape and a
semantic class label, and characterize uncertainties empirically using a large
amount of real-world data. Given a prior map, we use this model to select
actions for each robot to minimize uncertainties. The performance of our
algorithm is demonstrated through multi-robot experiments in diverse real-world
environments. The proposed framework is applicable to a wide range of

this work, we propose a single objective which jointly optimizes a latent-space

objective is a lower bound on expected returns. Unlike prior bounds for
model-based RL on policy exploration or model guarantees, our bound is directly
on the overall RL objective. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm

enormous scale, high dimensionality, and inherent uncertainty make almost every

imposing problem is that big data is often interspersed with sensitive personal
data. Hence, we propose a privacy-preserving hierarchical fuzzy neural network
(PP-HFNN) to address these technical challenges while also alleviating privacy
concerns. The network is trained with a two-stage optimization algorithm, and
the parameters at low levels of the hierarchy are learned with a scheme based
on the well-known alternating direction method of multipliers, which does not
reveal local data to other agents. Coordination at high levels of the hierarchy
is handled by the alternating optimization method, which converges very
quickly. The entire training procedure is scalable, fast and does not suffer
from gradient vanishing problems like the methods based on back-propagation.
Comprehensive simulations conducted on both regression and classification tasks

applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive neural approach for
high-quality reconstruction, compression, and rendering of human performances
from dense multi-view videos. Our core intuition is to bridge the traditional
animated mesh workflow with a new class of highly efficient neural techniques.
We first introduce a neural surface reconstructor for high-quality surface
generation in minutes. It marries the implicit volumetric rendering of the
truncated signed distance field (TSDF) with multi-resolution hash encoding. We
further propose a hybrid neural tracker to generate animated meshes, which
combines explicit non-rigid tracking with implicit dynamic deformation in a
self-supervised framework. The former provides the coarse warping back into the
canonical space, while the latter implicit one further predicts the
displacements using the 4D hash encoding as in our reconstructor. Then, we
discuss the rendering schemes using the obtained animated meshes, ranging from
dynamic texturing to lumigraph rendering under various bandwidth settings. To
strike an intricate balance between quality and bandwidth, we propose a
hierarchical solution by first rendering 6 virtual views covering the performer
and then conducting occlusion-aware neural texture blending. We demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in a variety of mesh-based applications and
photo-realistic free-view experiences on various platforms, i.e., inserting

paper, we focus on the equi-join problem, where a pair of records from the two
joined tables are part of the join results if equality holds between their
values in the join column(s). While this is a tractable problem when the number
of records in the joined tables is relatively small, it becomes very
challenging as the table sizes increase, especially if hot keys (join column
values with a large number of records) exist in both joined tables.
  This paper, an extended version of [metwally-SIGMOD-2022], proposes
Adaptive-Multistage-Join (AM-Join) for scalable and fast equi-joins in
distributed shared-nothing architectures. AM-Join utilizes (a) Tree-Join, a
proposed novel algorithm that scales well when the joined tables share hot
keys, and (b) Broadcast-Join, the known fastest when joining keys that are hot
in only one table.
  Unlike the state-of-the-art algorithms, AM-Join (a) holistically solves the
join-skew problem by achieving load balancing throughout the join execution,
and (b) supports all outer-join variants without record deduplication or custom
table partitioning. For the fastest AM-Join outer-join performance, we propose
the Index-Broadcast-Join (IB-Join) family of algorithms for Small-Large joins,
where one table fits in memory and the other can be up to orders of magnitude
larger. The outer-join variants of IB-Join improves on the state-of-the-art
Small-Large outer-join algorithms.
  The proposed algorithms can be adopted in any shared-nothing architecture. We
implemented a MapReduce version using Spark. Our evaluation shows the proposed
algorithms execute significantly faster and scale to more skewed and

optimization stage, we minimize the residual between the observed image and
rendered image by directly optimizing the pose on tangent plane. To avoid
convergence to local optimum, we introduce a Truncated Dynamic Low-pass Filter

Limited by the satellite positioning technology, further improving the accuracy

When matching a trajectory, the ego vehicle's spatial-temporal information of
the present trip is the most useful with the least amount of data. In addition,
there are a large amount of other data, e.g., other vehicles' state and past
prediction results, but it is hard to extract useful information for matching
maps and inferring paths. Most map-matching studies only used the ego vehicle's
data and ignored other vehicles' data. Based on it, this paper designs a new
map-matching method to make full use of ""Big data"". We first sort all data into
four groups according to their spatial and temporal distance from the present
matching probe which allows us to sort for their usefulness. Then we design
three different methods to extract valuable information (scores) from them: a
score for speed and bearing, a score for historical usage, and a score for
traffic state using the spectral graph Markov neutral network. Finally, we use
a modified top-K shortest-path method to search the candidate paths within an
ellipse region and then use the fused score to infer the path (projected

standardization weighting in RSBA (NW-RSBA) can avoid common planar degeneracy

without any external interpretability methods) and sample efficient (i.e.,
requiring substantially less training data than standard bug detectors). Our
extensive evaluation shows our meta bug detector (MBD) is effective in catching
a variety of bugs including null pointer dereference, array index out-of-bound,

  This article shows a different approach by defining a type-directed

program provides evidence for the availability of methods as additional
dictionary parameters, similar to the dictionary-passing approach known from
Haskell type classes. Then, method calls can be resolved by a simple lookup of
the method definition in the dictionary.
  Every program in the image of the translation has the same dynamic semantics

distributed computation. However, BFT protocols suffer from the ordering
manipulation, in which an adversary can make front-running. Several protocols

limitations for them. The batch-based protocols such as Themis has significant
performance loss because of the use of complex algorithms to find strongly

simplified the ordering phase, but they are limited on fairness that the
adversary can manipulate the ordering via timestamps of transactions. In this
paper, we propose a Byzantine ordered consensus protocol called Phalanx, in
which transactions are committed by anchor-based ordering strategy. The
anchor-based strategy makes aggregation of the Lamport logical clock of
transactions on each participant and generates the final ordering without
complex detection for SCCs. Therefore, Phalanx has achieved satisfying
performance and performs better in resisting ordering manipulation than
timestamp-based strategy.

various motion representations that have been used extensively, particularly in

probabilistic approaches have earned a relevant place, owing to their encoding
of variations, correlations and adaptability to new task conditions. Modulating
such primitives, however, is often cumbersome due to the need for parameter
re-optimization which frequently entails computationally costly operations. In
this paper we derive a non-parametric movement primitive formulation that

and efficient motion generation with computational complexity O(n2) without
involving matrix inversions, whose complexity is O(n3). This is achieved by
using the null space to track secondary targets, with a precision determined by
the training dataset. Using a 2D example associated with time input we show
that our non-parametric solution compares favourably with a state-of-the-art
parametric approach. For demonstrated skills with high-dimensional inputs we
show that it permits on-the-fly adaptation as well.

a novel training framework that explicitly encourages the VQA model to

obstacles based on LiDAR. First, point cloud is used to generate a real-time
local grid map for obstacle detection. Then, obstacles are clustered by DBSCAN
algorithm and enclosed with minimum bounding ellipses (MBEs). In addition, data
association is conducted to match each MBE with the obstacle in the current
frame. Considering MBE as an observation, Kalman filter (KF) is used to
estimate and predict the motion state of the obstacle. In this way, the
trajectory of each obstacle in the forward time domain can be parameterized as
a set of ellipses. Due to the uncertainty of the MBE, the semi-major and
semi-minor axes of the parameterized ellipse are extended to ensure safety. We
extend the traditional Control Barrier Function (CBF) and propose Dynamic
Control Barrier Function (D-CBF). We combine D-CBF with Model Predictive
Control (MPC) to implement safety-critical dynamic obstacle avoidance.
Experiments in simulated and real scenarios are conducted to verify the
effectiveness of our algorithm. The source code is released for the reference
of the community.

sensitive or confidential information about their training data. Recently,
leakage due to distribution inference (or property inference) attacks is
gaining attention. In this attack, the goal of an adversary is to infer
distributional information about the training data. So far, research on
distribution inference has focused on demonstrating successful attacks, with
little attention given to identifying the potential causes of the leakage and
to proposing mitigations. To bridge this gap, as our main contribution, we
theoretically and empirically analyze the sources of information leakage that
allows an adversary to perpetrate distribution inference attacks. We identify
three sources of leakage: (1) memorizing specific information about the
$\mathbb{E}[Y|X]$ (expected label given the feature values) of interest to the
adversary, (2) wrong inductive bias of the model, and (3) finiteness of the
training data. Next, based on our analysis, we propose principled mitigation
techniques against distribution inference attacks. Specifically, we demonstrate
that causal learning techniques are more resilient to a particular type of
distribution inference risk termed distributional membership inference than
associative learning methods. And lastly, we present a formalization of
distribution inference that allows for reasoning about more general adversaries
than was previously possible.

representation to rewrite the first subproblem that is originally formulated
with rotation matrices. The framework is configured with the Graduated
Non-Convexity (GNC) algorithm to solve the two non-convex subproblems in
succession without initial guesses. Thanks to the linearity properties of both
the subproblems, our framework requires only linear solvers to optimally solve
the optimization problems encountered in GNC. We extensively validate the
proposed framework, named DEGNC-LAF (DEcoupled Graduated Non-Convexity with
Linear Angle Formulation) in planar PGO benchmarks. It turns out that it runs
significantly (sometimes up to over 30 times) faster than the standard and

Given a starting point $S$ on the perimeter of the triangle, a feasible

a feasible solution (evacuation cost) is defined as the supremum over all

reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views from a sparse set of 2D
images. Albeit effective, the performance of NeRF is highly influenced by the
quality of training samples. With limited posed images from the scene, NeRF
fails to generalize well to novel views and may collapse to trivial solutions
in unobserved regions. This makes NeRF impractical under resource-constrained
scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel learning framework, ActiveNeRF,
aiming to model a 3D scene with a constrained input budget. Specifically, we
first incorporate uncertainty estimation into a NeRF model, which ensures
robustness under few observations and provides an interpretation of how NeRF
understands the scene. On this basis, we propose to supplement the existing
training set with newly captured samples based on an active learning scheme. By
evaluating the reduction of uncertainty given new inputs, we select the samples
that bring the most information gain. In this way, the quality of novel view
synthesis can be improved with minimal additional resources. Extensive
experiments validate the performance of our model on both realistic and

networks (DNNs). Lately, coresets (provable data summarizations) were leveraged
for pruning DNNs, adding the advantage of theoretical guarantees on the
trade-off between the compression rate and the approximation error. However,
coresets in this domain were either data-dependent or generated under
restrictive assumptions on both the model's weights and inputs. In real-world
scenarios, such assumptions are rarely satisfied, limiting the applicability of
coresets. To this end, we suggest a novel and robust framework for computing
such coresets under mild assumptions on the model's weights and without any
assumption on the training data. The idea is to compute the importance of each
neuron in each layer with respect to the output of the following layer. This is
achieved by a combination of L\""{o}wner ellipsoid and Caratheodory theorem. Our
method is simultaneously data-independent, applicable to various networks and
datasets (due to the simplified assumptions), and theoretically supported.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing coreset based
neural pruning approaches across a wide range of networks and datasets. For
example, our method achieved a $62\%$ compression rate on ResNet50 on ImageNet
with $1.09\%$ drop in accuracy.

would incur significant signaling and computational overhead. We can exploit
the deterministic topology of the satellite constellation to calculate the
minimum-delay path between any two nodes in the satellite network. But that
does not take into account the traffic information at the nodes along this
minimum-delay path. We propose a distributed probabilistic congestion control
scheme to minimize end-to-end delay. In the proposed scheme, each satellite,
while sending a packet to its neighbor, adds a header with a simple metric
indicating its own congestion level. The decision to route packets is taken
based on the latest traffic information received from the neighbors. We build
this algorithm onto the Datagram Routing Algorithm (DRA), which provides the
minimum delay path, and the decision for the next hop is taken by the
congestion control algorithm. We compare the proposed congestion control
mechanism with the existing congestion control used by the DRA via simulations,
and show improvements over the same.

salient visual regions like prominent image regions. In this paper, we attach
more importance to coarse-grained elements containing high-density information
and consistent semantics, which are valuable for document understanding. At
first, a document graph is proposed to model complex relationships among
multi-grained multimodal elements, in which salient visual regions are detected
by a cluster-based method. Then, a multi-grained multimodal Transformer called
mmLayout is proposed to incorporate coarse-grained information into existing
pre-trained fine-grained multimodal Transformers based on the graph. In
mmLayout, coarse-grained information is aggregated from fine-grained, and then,
after further processing, is fused back into fine-grained for final prediction.
Furthermore, common sense enhancement is introduced to exploit the semantic
information of natural lexical units. Experimental results on four tasks,
including information extraction and document question answering, show that our
method can improve the performance of multimodal Transformers based on

hippocampal place cells (PC) during sleep or immobility depicts trajectories
that can go around barriers and can flexibly adapt to a changing maze layout.
Such layout-conforming replay sheds a light on how the activity of place cells
supports the learning of flexible navigation of an animal in a dynamically
changing maze. However, existing computational models of replay fall short of
generating layout-conforming replay, restricting their usage to simple
environments, like linear tracks or open fields. In this paper, we propose a
computational model that generates layout-conforming replay and explains how
such replay drives the learning of flexible navigation in a maze. First, we
propose a Hebbian-like rule to learn the inter-PC synaptic strength during
exploring a maze. Then we use a continuous attractor network (CAN) with
feedback inhibition to model the interaction among place cells and hippocampal
interneurons. The activity bump of place cells drifts along a path in the maze,
which models layout-conforming replay. During replay in rest, the synaptic
strengths from place cells to striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) are learned
by a novel dopamine-modulated three-factor rule to store place-reward
associations. During goal-directed navigation, the CAN periodically generates
replay trajectories from the animal's location for path planning, and the
trajectory leading to a maximal MSN activity is followed by the animal. We have
implemented our model into a high-fidelity virtual rat in the MuJoCo physics
simulator. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that its superior
flexibility during navigation in a maze is due to a continuous re-learning of
inter-PC and PC-MSN synaptic strength.

navigation rely on robust data association to identify loop closures for
back-end trajectory optimization. In the case of autonomous underwater vehicles
(AUVs) equipped with multibeam echosounders (MBES), data association is
particularly challenging due to the scarcity of identifiable landmarks in the
seabed, the large drift in dead-reckoning navigation estimates to which AUVs
are prone and the low resolution characteristic of MBES data. Deep learning
solutions to loop closure detection have shown excellent performance on data
from more structured environments. However, their transfer to the seabed domain
is not immediate and efforts to port them are hindered by the lack of
bathymetric datasets. Thus, in this paper we propose a neural network
architecture aimed to showcase the potential of adapting such techniques to
correspondence matching in bathymetric data. We train our framework on real
bathymetry from an AUV mission and evaluate its performance on the tasks of
loop closure detection and coarse point cloud alignment. Finally, we show its
potential against a more traditional method and release both its implementation
and the dataset used.

force the entire swarm to converge to an agreement on its own value. We define
a performance metric for each players performance, proving a correlation
between this metric and the chances of the player to win the game. We then
present the globally optimal solution to the game and prove that unfortunately
it is unattainable in a distributed setting, due to the challenging

basecalling, translates the raw electrical signals into nucleotide bases (i.e.,
A, C, G, T). The second step, read mapping, finds the correct location of a
read in a reference genome. In existing genome analysis pipelines, basecalling
and read mapping are executed separately. We observe in this work that such
separate execution of the two most time-consuming steps inherently leads to (1)
significant data movement and (2) redundant computations on the data, slowing
down the genome analysis pipeline. This paper proposes GenPIP, an in-memory

inter-variable relationships to assist an optimization algorithm in finding
good solutions faster. Such inter-variable interactions can also be
automatically learned from high-performing solutions discovered at intermediate
iterations in an optimization run - a process called innovization. These
relations, if vetted by the users, can be enforced among newly generated
solutions to steer the optimization algorithm towards practically promising
regions in the search space. Challenges arise for large-scale problems where
the number of such variable relationships may be high. This paper proposes an
interactive knowledge-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization (IK-EMO)
framework that extracts hidden variable-wise relationships as knowledge from
evolving high-performing solutions, shares them with users to receive feedback,
and applies them back to the optimization process to improve its effectiveness.
The knowledge extraction process uses a systematic and elegant graph analysis
method which scales well with number of variables. The working of the proposed
IK-EMO is demonstrated on three large-scale real-world engineering design
problems. The simplicity and elegance of the proposed knowledge extraction
process and achievement of high-performing solutions quickly indicate the power
of the proposed framework. The results presented should motivate further such

inside memories, PIM circumvents the bottlenecks of data movements in
conventional digital hardware. However, an extra quantization step (i.e. PIM
quantization), typically with limited resolution due to hardware constraints,
is required to convert the analog computing results into digital domain.
Meanwhile, non-ideal effects extensively exist in PIM quantization because of
the imperfect analog-to-digital interface, which further compromises the
inference accuracy.
  In this paper, we propose a method for training quantized networks to
incorporate PIM quantization, which is ubiquitous to all PIM systems.
Specifically, we propose a PIM quantization aware training (PIM-QAT) algorithm,
and introduce rescaling techniques during backward and forward propagation by
analyzing the training dynamics to facilitate training convergence. We also
propose two techniques, namely batch normalization (BN) calibration and
adjusted precision training, to suppress the adverse effects of non-ideal
linearity and stochastic thermal noise involved in real PIM chips. Our method
is validated on three mainstream PIM decomposition schemes, and physically on a
prototype chip. Comparing with directly deploying conventionally trained
quantized model on PIM systems, which does not take into account this extra
quantization step and thus fails, our method provides significant improvement.
It also achieves comparable inference accuracy on PIM systems as that of

is suitable for dealing with local disturbances. However, its limitation lies
in the handling of situations that require non-quadratic objectives to achieve
a specific goal, as well as situations where countering the control disturbance
would require a locally suboptimal action. Recent works address this
shortcoming by exploiting Finite State Machines (FSMs) to compose the tasks in
such a way that the robot does not get stuck in local minima. Nevertheless, the
intrinsic trade-off between reactivity and modularity that characterizes FSMs

representations that can generalize in domains with limited labels. The recent
popularity of SSL has led to the development of several models that make use of
diverse training strategies, architectures, and data augmentation policies with
no existing unified framework to study or assess their effectiveness in
transfer learning. We propose a data-driven geometric strategy to analyze
different SSL models using local neighborhoods in the feature space induced by
each. Unlike existing approaches that consider mathematical approximations of
the parameters, individual components, or optimization landscape, our work aims
to explore the geometric properties of the representation manifolds learned by
SSL models. Our proposed manifold graph metrics (MGMs) provide insights into
the geometric similarities and differences between available SSL models, their
invariances with respect to specific augmentations, and their performances on
transfer learning tasks. Our key findings are two fold: (i) contrary to popular
belief, the geometry of SSL models is not tied to its training paradigm
(contrastive, non-contrastive, and cluster-based); (ii) we can predict the
transfer learning capability for a specific model based on the geometric
properties of its semantic and augmentation manifolds.

  Layer Caching",,,,,cs.LG cs.PF,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become an essential component in many
application domains including web-based services. A variety of these services
require high throughput and (close to) real-time features, for instance, to
respond or react to users' requests or to process a stream of incoming data on
time. However, the trend in DNN design is toward larger models with many layers
and parameters to achieve more accurate results. Although these models are
often pre-trained, the computational complexity in such large models can still
be relatively significant, hindering low inference latency. Implementing a
caching mechanism is a typical systems engineering solution for speeding up a
service response time. However, traditional caching is often not suitable for
DNN-based services. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end automated solution
to improve the performance of DNN-based services in terms of their
computational complexity and inference latency. Our caching method adopts the
ideas of self-distillation of DNN models and early exits. The proposed solution
is an automated online layer caching mechanism that allows early exiting of a
large model during inference time if the cache model in one of the early exits
is confident enough for final prediction. One of the main contributions of this
paper is that we have implemented the idea as an online caching, meaning that
the cache models do not need access to training data and perform solely based
on the incoming data at run-time, making it suitable for applications using
pre-trained models. Our experiments results on two downstream tasks (face and
object classification) show that, on average, caching can reduce the
computational complexity of those services up to 58\% (in terms of FLOPs count)
and improve their inference latency up to 46\% with low to zero reduction in
accuracy.

effective models for many relevant data generating processes. Statistical
theory on neural networks indicates graceful scaling of sample complexity. For
example, Joen & Van Roy (arXiv:2203.00246) demonstrate that, when data is
generated by a ReLU teacher network with $W$ parameters, an optimal learner
needs only $\tilde{O}(W/\epsilon)$ samples to attain expected error $\epsilon$.
However, existing computational theory suggests that, even for
single-hidden-layer teacher networks, to attain small error for all such
teacher networks, the computation required to achieve this sample complexity is
intractable. In this work, we fit single-hidden-layer neural networks to data
generated by single-hidden-layer ReLU teacher networks with parameters drawn
from a natural distribution. We demonstrate that stochastic gradient descent

of samples and total number of queries both nearly linear in the input

and selection of applicants. These tasks are fundamentally difficult, and
require combining evidence from multiple different aspects (what we term
""attributes""). In these applications, the number of applicants is often large,
and a common practice is to assign the task to multiple evaluators in a
distributed fashion. Specifically, in the often-used holistic allocation, each
evaluator is assigned a subset of the applicants, and is asked to assess all
relevant information for their assigned applicants. However, such an evaluation
process is subject to issues such as miscalibration (evaluators see only a
small fraction of the applicants and may not get a good sense of relative
quality), and discrimination (evaluators are influenced by irrelevant
information about the applicants). We identify that such attribute-based
evaluation allows alternative allocation schemes. Specifically, we consider
assigning each evaluator more applicants but fewer attributes per applicant,
termed segmented allocation. We compare segmented allocation to holistic
allocation on several dimensions via theoretical and experimental methods. We
establish various tradeoffs between these two approaches, and identify
conditions under which one approach results in more accurate evaluation than
the other.

providers (e.g., Infura) to run the consensus client logic on their behalf. As
a result, these wallets are light-weight and high-performant, but come with
security risks. A malicious provider can completely mislead the wallet, e.g.,
fake payments and balances, or censor transactions. On the other hand, light
clients, which are not in popular use today, allow decentralization, but at
inefficient linear bootstrapping complexity. This poses a dilemma between
decentralization and performance. In this paper, we design, implement, and
evaluate a new proof-of-stake (PoS) superlight client with logarithmic
bootstrapping complexity. Our key insight is to leverage the standard
existential honesty assumption, i.e., that the verifier (client) is connected
to at least one honest prover (full node). The proofs of PoS take the form of a
Merkle tree of PoS epochs. The verifier enrolls the provers in a bisection
game, in which the honest prover is destined to win once an adversarial Merkle
tree is challenged at sufficient depth. We implement a complete client that is
compatible with mainnet PoS Ethereum to evaluate our construction: compared to
the current light client construction proposed for PoS Ethereum, our client
improves time-to-completion by 9x, communication by 180x, and energy usage by
30x. We prove our construction secure and show how to employ it for other
proof-of-stake systems such as Cardano, Algorand, and Snow White.

in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, where direct deployment is often
infeasible, unethical, or expensive. When deployment environments are expected
to undergo changes (that is, dataset shifts), it is important for OPE methods
to perform robust evaluation of the policies amidst such changes. Existing
approaches consider robustness against a large class of shifts that can
arbitrarily change any observable property of the environment. This often
results in highly pessimistic estimates of the utilities, thereby invalidating
policies that might have been useful in deployment. In this work, we address
the aforementioned problem by investigating how domain knowledge can help
provide more realistic estimates of the utilities of policies. We leverage
human inputs on which aspects of the environments may plausibly change, and
adapt the OPE methods to only consider shifts on these aspects. Specifically,
we propose a novel framework, Robust OPE (ROPE), which considers shifts on a
subset of covariates in the data based on user inputs, and estimates worst-case
utility under these shifts. We then develop computationally efficient
algorithms for OPE that are robust to the aforementioned shifts for contextual
bandits and Markov decision processes. We also theoretically analyze the sample
complexity of these algorithms. Extensive experimentation with synthetic and
real world datasets from the healthcare domain demonstrates that our approach
not only captures realistic dataset shifts accurately, but also results in less
pessimistic policy evaluations.

realistic, but appropriate for the target domain, which (by assumption) is

Indeed, searching for relevant medical literature is a key phase in

Queries in this context are highly complex, based on Boolean logic, include
free-text terms and index terms from standardised terminologies (e.g., the

construct a relaxed version of LDCs (RLDCs) with constant query complexity and
almost linear codeword length over the binary alphabet, and used them to obtain
significantly-improved constructions of Probabilistically Checkable Proofs. In
this work, we study RLDCs in the standard Hamming-error setting, and introduce
their variants in the insertion and deletion (Insdel) error setting. Insdel
LDCs were first studied by Ostrovsky and Paskin-Cherniavsky, and are further
motivated by recent advances in DNA random access bio-technologies, in which
the goal is to retrieve individual files from a DNA storage database. Our first
result is an exponential lower bound on the length of Hamming RLDCs making 2

Gur and Lachish. Our result exhibits a ""phase-transition""-type behavior on the

misogyny and fat-shaming. In all three cases we find an increase in hate speech

to a spread of hate speech throughout the platform. Moreover, users are found
to pick up this new hateful speech for months after initially joining the

retrieve the KB information explicitly or embed it into model parameters for

systems may generate a response with conflicting entity information. To address
this issue, we propose to generate the entity autoregressively first and
leverage it to guide the response generation in an end-to-end system. To ensure
entity consistency, we impose a trie constraint on entity generation. We also

Tripadvisor) to sample fresh information of diverse paths to control the age of
information (AoI). However, selfish drivers prefer to travel through the
shortest path instead of the others with extra costs in time and gas. To
motivate drivers to route and sample diverse paths, this paper is the first to
propose online pricing for a provider to economically reward drivers for
diverse routing and control the actual AoI dynamics over time and spatial path
domains. This online pricing optimization problem should be solved without
knowing drivers' costs and even arrivals, and is intractable due to the curse
of dimensionality in both time and space. If there is only one non-shortest
path, we leverage the Markov decision process (MDP) techniques to analyze the
problem. Accordingly, we design a linear-time algorithm for returning optimal
online pricing, where a higher pricing reward is needed for a larger AoI. If
there are a number of non-shortest paths, we prove that pricing one path at a
time is optimal, yet it is not optimal to choose the path with the largest
current AoI. Then we propose a new backward-clustered computation method and
develop an approximation algorithm to alternate different paths to price over
time. Perhaps surprisingly, our analysis of approximation ratio suggests that
our algorithm's performance approaches closer to optimum given more paths.

It provides an essential enrichment to the widely used LISA Traffic Sign

only. This modular approach creates a highly scalable system. However, it comes
with a high-performance cost where a lack of global regularization at
deployment time leads to hyperactive neurons that erroneously respond to places
outside their learned region. Our second contribution introduces a
regularization approach that detects and removes these problematic hyperactive
neurons during the initial environmental learning phase. We evaluate this new

same in each dimension. The only input to the problem is thus the size of the
grid. This problem is equivalent to one of the most interesting problems in
classical physics, namely, computing the lowest energy of a classical system of
particles on the grid. We provide a tight characterization of the complexity of
this problem, and show that it is complete for the class $FP^{NEXP}$. Gottesman

nearest atoms of the query fingerprints from the MR-signal-evolution dictionary
with the L2 distance. However, we observed that the L2 distance is not always a

devices with a set of distinct $p$-dimensional vectors. We then propose to
jointly estimate parameters of all devices under the $M$-estimation framework
with the fused Lasso regularization, encouraging an equal estimate of
parameters on connected devices in $G$. We provide a general result for our
estimator depending on $G$, which can be further calibrated to obtain
convergence rates for various specific problem setups. Surprisingly, our
estimator attains the optimal rate under certain graph fidelity condition on
$G$, as if we could aggregate all samples sharing the same distribution. If the
graph fidelity condition is not met, we propose an edge selection procedure via
multiple testing to ensure the optimality. To ease the burden of local
computation, a decentralized stochastic version of ADMM is provided, with
convergence rate $O(T^{-1}\log T)$ where $T$ denotes the number of iterations.
We highlight that, our algorithm transmits only parameters along edges of $G$
at each iteration, without requiring a central machine, which preserves
privacy. We further extend it to the case where devices are randomly
inaccessible during the training process, with a similar algorithmic
convergence guarantee. The computational and statistical efficiency of our
method is evidenced by simulation experiments and the 2020 US presidential
election data set.

(EBM) in the latent space of the generator model. Learning such prior model
typically requires running costly Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Instead, we
propose to use noise contrastive estimation (NCE) to discriminatively learn the
EBM through density ratio estimation between the latent prior density and
latent posterior density. However, the NCE typically fails to accurately
estimate such density ratio given large gap between two densities. To
effectively tackle this issue and learn more expressive prior models, we
develop the adaptive multi-stage density ratio estimation which breaks the
estimation into multiple stages and learn different stages of density ratio
sequentially and adaptively. The latent prior model can be gradually learned
using ratio estimated in previous stage so that the final latent space EBM
prior can be naturally formed by product of ratios in different stages. The
proposed method enables informative and much sharper prior than existing
baselines, and can be trained efficiently. Our experiments demonstrate strong
performances in image generation and reconstruction as well as anomaly
detection.

injection techniques, which aim to automatically find failure-handling bugs in

specification of request-level faults, while also establishing a correspondence
between inter-service RPCs across multiple executions, as is required to
perform a systematic search of the fault space.In this paper, we formally
define the general concept of a distributed execution index, which can be
parameterized on different ways of identifying an RPC in a single service. We
identify an instantiation that maintains precision in the presence of a variety
of program structure complexities such as loops, function indirection, and
concurrency with scheduling nondeterminism. We demonstrate that this particular
instantiation addresses gaps in the state-of-the-art in request-level fault

state-of-the-art are Transformer-based approaches that focus on either feature
descriptors or cost volume aggregation. However, they generally aggregate one
or the other but not both, though joint aggregation would boost each other by
providing information that one has but other lacks, i.e., structural or
semantic information of an image, or pixel-wise matching similarity. In this
work, we propose a novel Transformer-based network that interleaves both forms
of aggregations in a way that exploits their complementary information.
Specifically, we design a self-attention layer that leverages the descriptor to
disambiguate the noisy cost volume and that also utilizes the cost volume to
aggregate features in a manner that promotes accurate matching. A subsequent
cross-attention layer performs further aggregation conditioned on the
descriptors of both images and aided by the aggregated outputs of earlier
layers. We further boost the performance with hierarchical processing, in which
coarser level aggregations guide those at finer levels. We evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed method on dense matching tasks and achieve
state-of-the-art performance on all the major benchmarks. Extensive ablation

  Estimation",,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Remarkable progress has been made in self-supervised monocular depth
estimation (SS-MDE) by exploring cross-view consistency, e.g., photometric
consistency and 3D point cloud consistency. However, they are very vulnerable
to illumination variance, occlusions, texture-less regions, as well as moving
objects, making them not robust enough to deal with various scenes. To address
this challenge, we study two kinds of robust cross-view consistency in this
paper. Firstly, the spatial offset field between adjacent frames is obtained by
reconstructing the reference frame from its neighbors via deformable alignment,
which is used to align the temporal depth features via a Depth Feature
Alignment (DFA) loss. Secondly, the 3D point clouds of each reference frame and
its nearby frames are calculated and transformed into voxel space, where the
point density in each voxel is calculated and aligned via a Voxel Density
Alignment (VDA) loss. In this way, we exploit the temporal coherence in both
depth feature space and 3D voxel space for SS-MDE, shifting the
""point-to-point"" alignment paradigm to the ""region-to-region"" one. Compared
with the photometric consistency loss as well as the rigid point cloud
alignment loss, the proposed DFA and VDA losses are more robust owing to the
strong representation power of deep features as well as the high tolerance of
voxel density to the aforementioned challenges. Experimental results on several
outdoor benchmarks show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
techniques. Extensive ablation study and analysis validate the effectiveness of
the proposed losses, especially in challenging scenes. The code and models are

systems as these entail a combination of background knowledge, reasoning and
pattern recognition. While symbolic systems ingest explicit domain knowledge
and perform deductive reasoning, they are sensitive to noise and require inputs
be mapped to preset symbolic features. Connectionist systems on the other hand
can directly ingest rich input spaces such as images, text or speech and
recognize pattern even with noisy inputs. However, connectionist models
struggle to include explicit domain knowledge for deductive reasoning. In this
paper, we propose a framework that combines the pattern recognition abilities
of neural networks with symbolic reasoning and background knowledge for solving
a class of Analogical Reasoning problems where the set of attributes and
possible relations across them are known apriori. We take inspiration from the
'neural algorithmic reasoning' approach [DeepMind 2020] and use
problem-specific background knowledge by (i) learning a distributed
representation based on a symbolic model of the problem (ii) training
neural-network transformations reflective of the relations involved in the
problem and finally (iii) training a neural network encoder from images to the
distributed representation in (i). These three elements enable us to perform
search-based reasoning using neural networks as elementary functions
manipulating distributed representations. We test this on visual analogy
problems in RAVENs Progressive Matrices, and achieve accuracy competitive with
human performance and, in certain cases, superior to initial end-to-end
neural-network based approaches. While recent neural models trained at scale
yield SOTA, our novel neuro-symbolic reasoning approach is a promising
direction for this problem, and is arguably more general, especially for
problems where domain knowledge is available.

during model training, but not available at test time. Such features naturally
arise in merchandised recommendation systems; for instance, ""user clicked this
item"" as a feature is predictive of ""user purchased this item"" in the offline
data, but is clearly not available during online serving. Another source of
privileged features is those that are too expensive to compute online but
feasible to be added offline. Privileged features distillation (PFD) refers to
a natural idea: train a ""teacher"" model using all features (including
privileged ones) and then use it to train a ""student"" model that does not use
the privileged features.
  In this paper, we first study PFD empirically on three public ranking
datasets and an industrial-scale ranking problem derived from Amazon's logs. We
show that PFD outperforms several baselines (no-distillation,
pretraining-finetuning, self-distillation, and generalized distillation) on all
these datasets. Next, we analyze why and when PFD performs well via both
empirical ablation studies and theoretical analysis for linear models. Both
investigations uncover an interesting non-monotone behavior: as the predictive
power of a privileged feature increases, the performance of the resulting
student model initially increases but then decreases. We show the reason for
the later decreasing performance is that a very predictive privileged teacher
produces predictions with high variance, which lead to high variance student
estimates and inferior testing performance.

nonlinear nonsmooth ordinary differential equations for a large number of
internal hysteretic states at Gauss points, to be used within the virtual work
calculation for dissipation. For such systems, numerical integration becomes
difficult due to both the distributed non-analytic nonlinearity of hysteresis
as well as the very high natural frequencies in the finite element model. Here
we offer two contributions. First, we present a simple semi-implicit
integration approach where the structural part is handled implicitly based on
the work of Pich\'e, and where the hysteretic part is handled explicitly. A
cantilever beam example is solved in detail using high mesh refinement.
Convergence is good for lower damping and a smoother hysteresis loop. For a
less smooth hysteresis loop and/or higher damping, convergence is observed to
be roughly linear on average. Encouragingly, the time step needed for stability
is much larger than the time period of the highest natural frequency of the
structural model. Subsequently, data from several simulations conducted using
the above semi-implicit method are used to construct reduced order models of
the system, where the structural dynamics is projected onto a small number of
modes and the number of hysteretic states is reduced significantly as well.
Convergence studies of error against the number of retained hysteretic states
show very good results.

view for abstract and commonsense concepts, and an instance view for specific
entities that are instantiated from ontological concepts. As such, these KGs
contain heterogeneous structures that are hierarchical, from the ontology-view,
and cyclical, from the instance-view. Despite these various structures in KGs,
most recent works on embedding KGs assume that the entire KG belongs to only
one of the two views but not both simultaneously. For works that seek to put
both views of the KG together, the instance and ontology views are assumed to
belong to the same geometric space, such as all nodes embedded in the same
Euclidean space or non-Euclidean product space, an assumption no longer
reasonable for two-view KGs where different portions of the graph exhibit
different structures. To address this issue, we define and construct a
dual-geometric space embedding model (DGS) that models two-view KGs using a
complex non-Euclidean geometric space, by embedding different portions of the
KG in different geometric spaces. DGS utilizes the spherical space, hyperbolic
space, and their intersecting space in a unified framework for learning
embeddings. Furthermore, for the spherical space, we propose novel closed
spherical space operators that directly operate in the spherical space without
the need for mapping to an approximate tangent space. Experiments on public
datasets show that DGS significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
baseline models on KG completion tasks, demonstrating its ability to better
model heterogeneous structures in KGs.

  Learning on Sparse Knowledge Graphs",,,,,cs.LG cs.AI cs.IR cs.SI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Knowledge graph (KG) embedding techniques use structured relationships
between entities to learn low-dimensional representations of entities and
relations. The traditional KG embedding techniques (such as TransE and
DistMult) estimate these embeddings via simple models developed over observed
KG triplets. These approaches differ in their triplet scoring loss functions.
As these models only use the observed triplets to estimate the embeddings, they
are prone to suffer through data sparsity that usually occurs in the real-world
knowledge graphs, i.e., the lack of enough triplets per entity. To settle this
issue, we propose an efficient method to augment the number of triplets to
address the problem of data sparsity. We use random walks to create additional
triplets, such that the relations carried by these introduced triplets entail
the metapath induced by the random walks. We also provide approaches to
accurately and efficiently filter out informative metapaths from the possible
set of metapaths, induced by the random walks. The proposed approaches are
model-agnostic, and the augmented training dataset can be used with any KG
embedding approach out of the box. Experimental results obtained on the
benchmark datasets show the advantages of the proposed approach.

  Histopathology Image Classification",,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Benefited from the rich and detailed spectral information in hyperspectral
images (HSI), HSI offers great potential for a wide variety of medical
applications such as computational pathology. But, the lack of adequate
annotated data and the high spatiospectral dimensions of HSIs usually make
classification networks prone to overfit. Thus, learning a general
representation which can be transferred to the downstream tasks is imperative.
To our knowledge, no appropriate self-supervised pre-training method has been
designed for histopathology HSIs. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and
effective Self-supervised Spectral Regression (S$^3$R) method, which exploits
the low rank characteristic in the spectral domain of HSI. More concretely, we
propose to learn a set of linear coefficients that can be used to represent one
band by the remaining bands via masking out these bands. Then, the band is
restored by using the learned coefficients to reweight the remaining bands. Two
pre-text tasks are designed: (1)S$^3$R-CR, which regresses the linear
coefficients, so that the pre-trained model understands the inherent structures
of HSIs and the pathological characteristics of different morphologies;
(2)S$^3$R-BR, which regresses the missing band, making the model to learn the
holistic semantics of HSIs. Compared to prior arts i.e., contrastive learning
methods, which focuses on natural images, S$^3$R converges at least 3 times
faster, and achieves significant improvements up to 14% in accuracy when
transferring to HSI classification tasks.

utilized the null-hypothesis test as a post-hoc ownership verification on the
imitation models. However, we find that it is possible to detect those
watermarks via sufficient statistics of the frequencies of candidate
watermarking words. To address this drawback, in this paper, we propose a novel
Conditional wATERmarking framework (CATER) for protecting the IP of text

rules that can minimize the distortion of overall word distributions while
maximizing the change of conditional word selections. Theoretically, we prove
that it is infeasible for even the savviest attacker (they know how CATER
works) to reveal the used watermarks from a large pool of potential word pairs
based on statistical inspection. Empirically, we observe that high-order
conditions lead to an exponential growth of suspicious (unused) watermarks,
making our crafted watermarks more stealthy. In addition, \cater can
effectively identify the IP infringement under architectural mismatch and
cross-domain imitation attacks, with negligible impairments on the generation
quality of victim APIs. We envision our work as a milestone for stealthily

dimensional space, answering queries by dense similarity search. However,
previous works mainly concentrate on the target answers, ignoring intermediate

Further, the estimation errors propagated over time due to inexact neighboring

a robust DMPC strategy is deliberately designed to achieve robust consensus
while satisfying input constraints. Moreover, it is shown that, with the
suitably designed cost function and constraints, the feasibility of the

the consensus convergence result of the constrained MAS in the presence of
bounded varying delays. Finally, two numerical examples are given to verify the

existing face representations pursue the bandwidth of handling scale variation

Such multi-shot scheme brings inference burden, and the predefined scales
inevitably have gap from real data. Instead, learning scale parameters from
data, and using them for one-shot feature inference, is a decent solution. To
this end, we reform the conv layer by resorting to the scale-space theory, and
achieve two-fold facilities: 1) the conv layer learns a set of scales from real
data distribution, each of which is fulfilled by a conv kernel; 2) the layer
automatically highlights the feature at the proper channel and location
corresponding to the input pattern scale and its presence. Then, we accomplish
the hierarchical scale attention by stacking the reformed layers, building a
novel style named SCale AttentioN Conv Neural Network (\textbf{SCAN-CNN}). We
apply SCAN-CNN to the face recognition task and push the frontier of SOTA
performance. The accuracy gain is more evident when the face images are blurry.
Meanwhile, as a single-shot scheme, the inference is more efficient than
multi-shot fusion. A set of tools are made to ensure the fast training of
SCAN-CNN and zero increase of inference cost compared with the plain CNN.

sensing magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MRI) has achieved popularity in the
field of medical imaging because of its less data requirement than parallel

acquisition time is inversely proportional to the number of samples, the
inverse formation of an image from reduced k-space samples leads to faster
acquisition but with aliasing artifacts. This paper proposes a novel Generative

learning to make the GAN network self-resistant to generating unnecessary data
which drives the convergence of the reconstruction process faster. Results:
Comprehensive results show that the proposed RECGAN-GR achieves a 4 dB
improvement in the PSNR among the GAN-based methods and a 2 dB improvement
among conventional state-of-the-art CNN methods available in the literature.
Conclusion and significance: The proposed work contributes to significant
improvement in the image quality for low retained data leading to 5x or 10x

importance, as it allows assessing the success of content moderation processes.
So far, intervention effects have been almost solely evaluated at the
aggregated platform or community levels. Here, we carry out a multidimensional
evaluation of the user level effects of the sequence of moderation
interventions that targeted r/The_Donald: a community of Donald Trump adherents
on Reddit. We demonstrate that the interventions (i) strongly reduced user
activity, (ii) slightly increased the diversity of the subreddits in which
users participated, (iii) slightly reduced user toxicity, and (iv) led users to
share less factual and more politically biased news. Importantly, we also find
that interventions having strong community level effects also cause extreme and
diversified user level reactions. Our results highlight that platform and
community level effects are not always representative of the underlying
behavior of individuals or smaller user groups. We conclude by discussing the
practical and ethical implications of our results. Overall, our findings can
inform the development of targeted moderation interventions and provide useful
guidance for policing online platforms.

  Duan",LMBAO: A Landmark Map for Bundle Adjustment Odometry in LiDAR SLAM,"9 pages, 3 tables, 6 figures",,,,cs.CV cs.RO,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  LiDAR odometry is one of the essential parts of LiDAR simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM). However, existing LiDAR odometry tends to
match a new scan simply iteratively with previous fixed-pose scans, gradually
accumulating errors. Furthermore, as an effective joint optimization mechanism,
bundle adjustment (BA) cannot be directly introduced into real-time odometry
due to the intensive computation of large-scale global landmarks. Therefore,
this letter designs a new strategy named a landmark map for bundle adjustment
odometry (LMBAO) in LiDAR SLAM to solve these problems. First, BA-based
odometry is further developed with an active landmark maintenance strategy for
a more accurate local registration and avoiding cumulative errors.
Specifically, this paper keeps entire stable landmarks on the map instead of
just their feature points in the sliding window and deletes the landmarks
according to their active grade. Next, the sliding window length is reduced,
and marginalization is performed to retain the scans outside the window but
corresponding to active landmarks on the map, greatly simplifying the
computation and improving the real-time properties. In addition, experiments on
three challenging datasets show that our algorithm achieves real-time
performance in outdoor driving and outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM
algorithms, including Lego-LOAM and VLOM.

optimal in the $L^2(\Omega)$ norm provided that $\varrho(x)$ behaves like the
local mesh size squared. This is especially important when adaptive meshes are
used in order to approximate discontinuous target functions. The adaptive
scheme can be driven by the computable and localizable error norm $\|

remains a challenging problem for robotic manipulation. Existing numerical
solvers are broadly applicable, but rely on local search techniques to manage
highly nonconvex objective functions. Recently, learning-based approaches have
shown promise as a means to generate fast and accurate IK results; learned
solvers can easily be integrated with other learning algorithms in end-to-end
systems. However, learning-based methods have an Achilles' heel: each robot of
interest requires a specialized model which must be trained from scratch. To
address this key shortcoming, we investigate a novel distance-geometric robot
representation coupled with a graph structure that allows us to leverage the
flexibility of graph neural networks (GNNs). We use this approach to train the
first learned generative graphical inverse kinematics (GGIK) solver that is,
crucially, ""robot-agnostic""-a single model is able to provide IK solutions for
a variety of different robots. Additionally, the generative nature of GGIK
allows the solver to produce a large number of diverse solutions in parallel
with minimal additional computation time, making it appropriate for
applications such as sampling-based motion planning. Finally, GGIK can
complement local IK solvers by providing reliable initializations. These
advantages, as well as the ability to use task-relevant priors and to
continuously improve with new data, suggest that GGIK has the potential to be a
key component of flexible, learning-based robotic manipulation systems.

  Probabilistic Models","Accepted at The IEEE conference series on Automatic Face and Gesture
  Recognition 2023",,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Modern-day surveillance systems perform person recognition using deep
learning-based face verification networks. Most state-of-the-art facial
verification systems are trained using visible spectrum images. But, acquiring
images in the visible spectrum is impractical in scenarios of low-light and
nighttime conditions, and often images are captured in an alternate domain such
as the thermal infrared domain. Facial verification in thermal images is often
performed after retrieving the corresponding visible domain images. This is a
well-established problem often known as the Thermal-to-Visible (T2V) image
translation. In this paper, we propose a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic
Model (DDPM) based solution for T2V translation specifically for facial images.
During training, the model learns the conditional distribution of visible
facial images given their corresponding thermal image through the diffusion
process. During inference, the visible domain image is obtained by starting
from Gaussian noise and performing denoising repeatedly. The existing inference
process for DDPMs is stochastic and time-consuming. Hence, we propose a novel
inference strategy for speeding up the inference time of DDPMs, specifically
for the problem of T2V image translation. We achieve the state-of-the-art
results on multiple datasets. The code and pretrained models are publically

To rapid recovery of program execution under power failures, the execution

checkpoint setting triggered by function calls is proposed to reduce the write

NVM backup size for stack backup, compared to the log-based method and
step-based method. In order to better achieve this, we also propose
pseudo-function calls to increase backup points to reduce recovery costs, and
exponential incremental call-based backup methods to reduce backup costs in the

to clean the contents on the NVM that are useless for restoration is proposed.

adopt a finite volume elements discretization approach over a generic

in a combination of a graded mesh near the singularity and a uniform mesh where
the solution is smooth. Such a choice gives rise to Toeplitz-like
discretization matrices and thus allows a low computational cost of the
matrix-vector product and a detailed spectral analysis. The obtained spectral
information is used to develop an ad-hoc parameter free multigrid
preconditioner for GMRES, which is numerically shown to yield good convergence
results in presence of graded meshes mapped by power functions that accumulate
points near the singularity. The approximation order of the considered graded
meshes is numerically compared with the one of a certain composite mesh given
in literature that still leads to Toeplitz-like linear systems and is then
still well-suited for our multigrid method. Several numerical tests confirm
that power graded meshes result in lower approximation errors than composite
ones and that our solver has a wide range of applicability.

2209.08848,Dangxing Chen,Dangxing Chen,Two-stage Modeling for Prediction with Confidence,,,,,q-fin.CP cs.AI cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The use of neural networks has been very successful in a wide variety of
applications. However, it has recently been observed that it is difficult to
generalize the performance of neural networks under the condition of
distributional shift. Several efforts have been made to identify potential
out-of-distribution inputs. Although existing literature has made significant
progress with regard to images and textual data, finance has been overlooked.
The aim of this paper is to investigate the distribution shift in the credit
scoring problem, one of the most important applications of finance. For the
potential distribution shift problem, we propose a novel two-stage model. Using
the out-of-distribution detection method, data is first separated into
confident and unconfident sets. As a second step, we utilize the domain
knowledge with a mean-variance optimization in order to provide reliable bounds
for unconfident samples. Using empirical results, we demonstrate that our model
offers reliable predictions for the vast majority of datasets. It is only a
small portion of the dataset that is inherently difficult to judge, and we
leave them to the judgment of human beings. Based on the two-stage model,
highly confident predictions have been made and potential risks associated with
the model have been significantly reduced.

meaning require external mask. This paper proposes a blind mask face inpainting
method using residual attention UNet to remove the face mask and restore the
face with fine details while minimizing the gap with the ground truth face
structure. A residual block feeds info to the next layer and directly into the
layers about two hops away to solve the gradient vanishing problem. Besides,
the attention unit helps the model focus on the relevant mask region, reducing
resources and making the model faster. Extensive experiments on the publicly

sensor poses and scene geometry, which is a fundamental problem in robot
vision. This paper presents an efficient and consistent bundle adjustment
method for lidar sensors. The method employs edge and plane features to
represent the scene geometry, and directly minimizes the natural Euclidean
distance from each raw point to the respective geometry feature. A nice
property of this formulation is that the geometry features can be analytically
solved, drastically reducing the dimension of the numerical optimization. To
represent and solve the resultant optimization problem more efficiently, this
paper then proposes a novel concept {\it point clusters}, which encodes all raw
points associated to the same feature by a compact set of parameters, the {\it
point cluster coordinates}. We derive the closed-form derivatives, up to the
second order, of the BA optimization based on the point cluster coordinates and
show their theoretical properties such as the null spaces and sparsity. Based
on these theoretical results, this paper develops an efficient second-order BA
solver. Besides estimating the lidar poses, the solver also exploits the second
order information to estimate the pose uncertainty caused by measurement
noises, leading to consistent estimates of lidar poses. Moreover, thanks to the
use of point cluster, the developed solver fundamentally avoids the enumeration
of each raw point (which is very time-consuming due to the large number) in all
steps of the optimization: cost evaluation, derivatives evaluation and
uncertainty evaluation. The implementation of our method is open sourced to
benefit the robotics community and beyond.

research topic on automatically complementing knowledge graphs. However,
evaluation of knowledge graph completion (KGC) models often ignores the
incompleteness -- facts in the test set are ranked against all unknown triplets
which may contain a large number of missing facts not included in the KG yet.
Treating all unknown triplets as false is called the closed-world assumption.
This closed-world assumption might negatively affect the fairness and
consistency of the evaluation metrics. In this paper, we study KGC evaluation
under a more realistic setting, namely the open-world assumption, where unknown
triplets are considered to include many missing facts not included in the
training or test sets. For the currently most used metrics such as mean
reciprocal rank (MRR) and Hits@K, we point out that their behavior may be
unexpected under the open-world assumption. Specifically, with not many missing
facts, their numbers show a logarithmic trend with respect to the true strength
of the model, and thus, the metric increase could be insignificant in terms of
reflecting the true model improvement. Further, considering the variance, we
show that the degradation in the reported numbers may result in incorrect
comparisons between different models, where stronger models may have lower
metric numbers. We validate the phenomenon both theoretically and
experimentally. Finally, we suggest possible causes and solutions for this
problem. Our code and data are available at

has been a mystery for a long time. It has not been revealed with the existence
of gradient correction until the high-resolution differential equation
framework proposed in [Shi et al., 2021]. In this paper, we continue to
investigate the acceleration phenomenon. First, we provide a significantly
simplified proof based on precise observation and a tighter inequality for
$L$-smooth functions. Then, a new implicit-velocity high-resolution
differential equation framework, as well as the corresponding implicit-velocity
version of phase-space representation and Lyapunov function, is proposed to
investigate the convergence behavior of the iterative sequence
$\{x_k\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ of NAG. Furthermore, from two kinds of phase-space
representations, we find that the role played by gradient correction is
equivalent to that by velocity included implicitly in the gradient, where the
only difference comes from the iterative sequence $\{y_{k}\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$
replaced by $\{x_k\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$. Finally, for the open question of whether
the gradient norm minimization of NAG has a faster rate $o(1/k^3)$, we figure
out a positive answer with its proof. Meanwhile, a faster rate of objective
value minimization $o(1/k^2)$ is shown for the case $r > 2$.

vulnerable to 3D steganalyzers. In this paper, we propose a highly adaptive 3D
mesh steganography based on feature-preserving distortion (FPD), which
guarantees high embedding capacity while effectively resisting 3D steganalysis.
Specifically, we first transform vertex coordinates into integers and derive
bitplanes from them to construct the embedding domain. To better measure the
mesh distortion caused by message embedding, we propose FPD based on the most
effective sub-features of the state-of-the-art steganalytic feature set. By
improving and minimizing FPD, we can efficiently calculate the optimal
vertex-changing distribution and simultaneously preserve mesh features, such as
steganalytic and geometric features, to a certain extent. By virtue of the
optimal distribution, we adopt the Q-layered syndrome trellis coding (STC) for
practical message embedding. However, when Q varies, calculating bit
modification probability (BMP) in each layer of Q-layered will be cumbersome.
Hence, we contrapuntally design a universal and automatic BMP calculation
approach. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm outperforms most state-of-the-art 3D mesh steganographic algorithms

uncertainties of external intervention impacts on electricity demand. It
implements a framework that combines probabilistic and global forecasting
models using a deep learning approach to estimate the causal impact
distribution of an intervention. The causal effect is assessed by predicting
the counterfactual distribution outcome for the affected instances and then
contrasting it to the real outcomes. We consider the impact of Covid-19

However, existing methods seldom study the various importance of reconstructed

medical images. In this paper we propose a novel Attentive Symmetric
Auto-encoder (ASA) based on Vision Transformer (ViT) for 3D brain MRI
segmentation tasks. We conjecture that forcing the auto-encoder to recover
informative image regions can harvest more discriminative representations, than
to recover smooth image patches. Then we adopt a gradient based metric to
estimate the importance of each image patch. In the pre-training stage, the
proposed auto-encoder pays more attention to reconstruct the informative
patches according to the gradient metrics. Moreover, we resort to the prior of
brain structures and develop a Symmetric Position Encoding (SPE) method to
better exploit the correlations between long-range but spatially symmetric
regions to obtain effective features. Experimental results show that our
proposed attentive symmetric auto-encoder outperforms the state-of-the-art

field of deep RL (DRL). However a number of scientific and technical challenges
still need to be resolved, amongst which we can mention the ability to abstract
actions or the difficulty to explore the environment in sparse-reward settings
which can be addressed by intrinsic motivation (IM). We propose to survey these
research works through a new taxonomy based on information theory: we
computationally revisit the notions of surprise, novelty and skill learning.
This allows us to identify advantages and disadvantages of methods and exhibit
current outlooks of research. Our analysis suggests that novelty and surprise
can assist the building of a hierarchy of transferable skills that further
abstracts the environment and makes the exploration process more robust.

Provided with textual descriptions, these models are capable of generating
high-quality images depicting various concepts and styles. However, such models
are trained on large amounts of public data and implicitly learn relationships
from their training data that are not immediately apparent. We demonstrate that
common multimodal models implicitly learned cultural biases that can be
triggered and injected into the generated images by simply replacing single
characters in the textual description with visually similar non-Latin
characters. These so-called homoglyph replacements enable malicious users or
service providers to induce biases into the generated images and even render
the whole generation process useless. We practically illustrate such attacks on
DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion as text-guided image generation models and
further show that CLIP also behaves similarly. Our results further indicate
that text encoders trained on multilingual data provide a way to mitigate the

Normalization (BLN) to reduce the problem of internal covariate shift in deep

BLN adaptively puts appropriate weight on mini-batch and feature normalization

during the learning process. It also performs the exact computation with a
minor change at inference times, using either mini-batch statistics or
population statistics. The decision process to either use statistics of
mini-batch or population gives BLN the ability to play a comprehensive role in
the hyper-parameter optimization process of models. The key advantage of BLN is
the support of the theoretical analysis of being independent of the input data,
and its statistical configuration heavily depends on the task performed, the
amount of training data, and the size of batches. Test results indicate the
application potential of BLN and its faster convergence than batch

quality. In this paper, we propose an exact approach based on the
branch-and-cut technique to solve the cardinality-constrained MSSC. For the
lower bound routine, we use the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation
recently proposed by Rujeerapaiboon et al. [SIAM J. Optim. 29(2), 1211-1239,

for small-size instances. Therefore, we derive a new SDP relaxation that scales
better with the instance size and the number of clusters. In both cases, we
strengthen the bound by adding polyhedral cuts. Benefiting from a tailored
branching strategy which enforces pairwise constraints, we reduce the
complexity of the problems arising in the children nodes. For the upper bound,
instead, we present a local search procedure that exploits the solution of the
SDP relaxation solved at each node. Computational results show that the
proposed algorithm globally solves, for the first time, real-world instances of

entertainment are spread via online social media every day, necessitating fake
news detection for multiple domains. Among them, fake news in specific domains
like politics and health has more serious potential negative impacts on the
real world (e.g., the infodemic led by COVID-19 misinformation). Previous
studies focus on multi-domain fake news detection, by equally mining and
modeling the correlation between domains. However, these multi-domain methods
suffer from a seesaw problem: the performance of some domains is often improved
at the cost of hurting the performance of other domains, which could lead to an
unsatisfying performance in specific domains. To address this issue, we propose
a Domain- and Instance-level Transfer Framework for Fake News Detection
(DITFEND), which could improve the performance of specific target domains. To
transfer coarse-grained domain-level knowledge, we train a general model with
data of all domains from the meta-learning perspective. To transfer
fine-grained instance-level knowledge and adapt the general model to a target
domain, we train a language model on the target domain to evaluate the
transferability of each data instance in source domains and re-weigh each
instance's contribution. Offline experiments on two datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of DITFEND. Online experiments show that DITFEND brings
additional improvements over the base models in a real-world scenario.

that any constructive sequent calculus stronger than $\mathbf{CK}$ satisfying a
mild technical condition, feasibly admits all Visser's rules, i.e., there is a
polynomial time algorithm that reads a proof of the premise of a Visser's rule
and provides a proof for its conclusion. This connection has two types of
applications. On the positive side, it proves the feasible admissibility of
Visser's rules in the sequent system for several intuitionistic modal logics,

occlusions. To alleviate this problem, we present a unified convolutional
neural network (CNN) model that jointly considers homography, visibility, and
confidence. First, we introduce correlation blocks that explicitly account for
the local appearance changes and camera-object relative motions as the base of
our model. Second, we jointly learn the homography and visibility that links
camera-object relative motions with occlusions. Third, we propose a confidence
module that actively monitors the estimation quality from the pixel correlation
distributions obtained in correlation blocks. All these modules are plugged
into a Lucas-Kanade (LK) tracking pipeline to obtain both accurate and robust
planar object tracking. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
on public POT and TMT datasets. Its superior performance is also verified on a
real-world application, synthesizing high-quality in-video advertisements.

tight upper bound has remained opened since Guibas and Odlyzko's paper. Here,

similar bounds for the number of correlations: a generalization of
autocorrelations which encodes the overlaps between two strings.

reweighting is a normal way to handle the subpopulation shift issue by imposing
constant or adaptive sampling weights on each sample in the training dataset.
However, some recent studies have recognized that most of these approaches fail
to improve the performance over empirical risk minimization especially when
applied to over-parameterized neural networks. In this work, we propose a
simple yet practical framework, called uncertainty-aware mixup (Umix), to
mitigate the overfitting issue in over-parameterized models by reweighting the
""mixed"" samples according to the sample uncertainty. The
training-trajectories-based uncertainty estimation is equipped in the proposed
Umix for each sample to flexibly characterize the subpopulation distribution.
We also provide insightful theoretical analysis to verify that Umix achieves
better generalization bounds over prior works. Further, we conduct extensive

Recently, order-preserving matching was proposed to find all occurrences of a
pattern in a time series, where the pattern is a relative order (regarded as a
trend) and an occurrence is a sub-time series whose relative order coincides
with the pattern. Inspired by the order-preserving matching, the existing
order-preserving pattern (OPP) mining algorithm employs order-preserving
matching to calculate the support, which leads to low efficiency. To address
this deficiency, this paper proposes an algorithm called efficient frequent OPP
miner (EFO-Miner) to find all frequent OPPs. EFO-Miner is composed of four
parts: a pattern fusion strategy to generate candidate patterns, a matching
process for the results of sub-patterns to calculate the support of
super-patterns, a screening strategy to dynamically reduce the size of prefix

candidate patterns. Moreover, this paper explores the order-preserving rule

OPR-Miner gives better performance than other competitive algorithms. More

accelerate memory-bound NNs. However, PIM architectures vary in form, where
different PIM approaches lead to different trade-offs. Our goal is to analyze,
discuss, and contrast DRAM-based PIM architectures for NN performance and

architectures: (1) UPMEM, which integrates processors and DRAM arrays into a
single 2D chip; (2) Mensa, a 3D-stack-based PIM architecture tailored for edge
devices; and (3) SIMDRAM, which uses the analog principles of DRAM to execute
bit-serial operations. Our analysis reveals that PIM greatly benefits
memory-bound NNs: (1) UPMEM provides 23x the performance of a high-end GPU when
the GPU requires memory oversubscription for a general matrix-vector
multiplication kernel; (2) Mensa improves energy efficiency and throughput by

  Feature Fusion","12 pages, 5 figures",,,,cs.SE,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Background: Code summarization automatically generates the corresponding
natural language descriptions according to the input code. Comprehensiveness of
code representation is critical to code summarization task. However, most
existing approaches typically use coarse-grained fusion methods to integrate
multi-modal features. They generally represent different modalities of a piece
of code, such as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and a token sequence, as two
embeddings and then fuse the two ones at the AST/code levels. Such a coarse
integration makes it difficult to learn the correlations between fine-grained
code elements across modalities effectively. Aims: This study intends to
improve the model's prediction performance for high-quality code summarization
by accurately aligning and fully fusing semantic and syntactic structure
information of source code at node/token levels. Method: This paper proposes a
Multi-Modal Fine-grained Feature Fusion approach (MMF3) for neural code
summarization. We introduce a novel fine-grained fusion method, which allows
fine-grained fusion of multiple code modalities at the token and node levels.
Specifically, we use this method to fuse information from both token and AST
modalities and apply the fused features to code summarization. Results: We
conduct experiments on one Java and one Python datasets, and evaluate generated
summaries using four metrics. The results show that: 1) the performance of our
model outperforms the current state-of-the-art models, and 2) the ablation
experiments show that our proposed fine-grained fusion method can effectively
improve the accuracy of generated summaries. Conclusion: MMF3 can mine the
relationships between crossmodal elements and perform accurate fine-grained
element-level alignment fusion accordingly. As a result, more clues can be
provided to improve the accuracy of the generated code summaries.

alone without connection between words and their meaning. Consequently,
multimodal training has been proposed as a way for creating models with better

pre-trained multimodal vision-and-language (VL) models for which there already
are some results on their language understanding capabilities. An unresolved
issue with evaluating the linguistic skills of these models, however, is that
there is no established method for adapting them to text-only input without
out-of-distribution uncertainty. To find the best approach, we investigate and
compare seven possible methods for adapting three different pre-trained VL
models to text-only input. Our evaluations on both GLUE and Visual Property
Norms (VPN) show that care should be put into adapting VL models to zero-shot
text-only tasks, while the models are less sensitive to how we adapt them to
non-zero-shot tasks. We also find that the adaptation methods perform
differently for different models and that unimodal model counterparts perform
on par with the VL models regardless of adaptation, indicating that current VL
models do not necessarily gain better language understanding from their
multimodal training.

novel algorithm based on the channel statistics of massive multiple input
multiple output systems rather than the CSI. The beamforming at the base
station (BS), power allocation of the users, and phase shifts at the RIS
elements are optimized to maximize the minimum signal to interference and noise
ratio (SINR), guaranteeing fair operation among various users. In particular,
we design the RIS phases by leveraging the asymptotic deterministic equivalent
of the minimum SINR that depends only on the channel statistics. This
significantly reduces the computational complexity and the amount of
controlling data between the BS and RIS for updating the phases. This setup is
also useful for electromagnetic fields (EMF)-aware systems with constraints on
the maximum user's exposure to EMF. The numerical results show that the
proposed algorithms achieve more than 100% gain in terms of minimum SINR,

achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks, but with high
computational and energy cost. To improve its efficiency, a popular choice is
to compress the models via binarization which constrains the floating-point
values into binary ones to save resource consumption owing to cheap bitwise
operations significantly. However, existing binarization methods only aim at
minimizing the information loss for the input distribution statistically, while
ignoring the pairwise similarity modeling at the core of the attention
mechanism. To this end, we propose a new binarization paradigm customized to
high-dimensional softmax attention via kernelized hashing, called EcoFormer, to
map the original queries and keys into low-dimensional binary codes in Hamming
space. The kernelized hash functions are learned to match the ground-truth
similarity relations extracted from the attention map in a self-supervised way.
Based on the equivalence between the inner product of binary codes and the
Hamming distance as well as the associative property of matrix multiplication,
we can approximate the attention in linear complexity by expressing it as a
dot-product of binary codes. Moreover, the compact binary representations of
queries and keys enable us to replace most of the expensive multiply-accumulate
operations in attention with simple accumulations to save considerable on-chip
energy footprint on edge devices. Extensive experiments on both vision and
language tasks show that EcoFormer consistently achieves comparable performance
with standard attentions while consuming much fewer resources. For example,
based on PVTv2-B0 and ImageNet-1K, Ecoformer achieves a 73% energy footprint
reduction with only a 0.33% performance drop compared to the standard
attention. Code is available at https://github.com/ziplab/EcoFormer.

a learning-based auction, which can encode the correlation of values into the

encoding game theoretical conditions into the neural network structure.
Furthermore, all operations in the designed auctions are differentiable to

cardiac cycle and capture anomaly with cardiovascular signals. However, in the
field of deep semantic segmentation, inference is often unilaterally confounded
by the individual attribute of data. Towards cardiovascular signals,
quasi-periodicity is the essential characteristic to be learned, regarded as
the synthesize of the attributes of morphology (Am) and rhythm (Ar). Our key
insight is to suppress the over-dependence on Am or Ar while the generation
process of deep representations. To address this issue, we establish a
structural causal model as the foundation to customize the intervention
approaches on Am and Ar, respectively. In this paper, we propose contrastive
causal intervention (CCI) to form a novel training paradigm under a frame-level
contrastive framework. The intervention can eliminate the implicit statistical
bias brought by the single attribute and lead to more objective
representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments with the controlled
condition for QRS location and heart sound segmentation. The final results
indicate that our approach can evidently improve the performance by up to 0.41%
for QRS location and 2.73% for heart sound segmentation. The efficiency of the
proposed method is generalized to multiple databases and noisy signals.

particularly vulnerable to model stealing attacks due to the high
dimensionality of vector representations they output. Yet, encoders remain
undefended: existing mitigation strategies for stealing attacks focus on
supervised learning. We introduce a new dataset inference defense, which uses
the private training set of the victim encoder model to attribute its ownership
in the event of stealing. The intuition is that the log-likelihood of an
encoder's output representations is higher on the victim's training data than
on test data if it is stolen from the victim, but not if it is independently
trained. We compute this log-likelihood using density estimation models. As
part of our evaluation, we also propose measuring the fidelity of stolen
encoders and quantifying the effectiveness of the theft detection without
involving downstream tasks; instead, we leverage mutual information and
distance measurements. Our extensive empirical results in the vision domain
demonstrate that dataset inference is a promising direction for defending

which requires solving hard constrained optimization problems iteratively. For
uncertain dynamics, analytical model based robust MPC imposes additional
constraints, increasing the hardness of the problem. The problem exacerbates in
performance-critical applications, when more compute is required in lesser
time. Data-driven regression methods such as Neural Networks have been proposed
in the past to approximate system dynamics. However, such models rely on high
volumes of labeled data, in the absence of symbolic analytical priors. This
incurs non-trivial training overheads. Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
have gained traction for approximating non-linear system of ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), with reasonable accuracy. In this work, we
propose a Robust Adaptive MPC framework via PINNs (RAMP-Net), which uses a
neural network trained partly from simple ODEs and partly from data. A physics
loss is used to learn simple ODEs representing ideal dynamics. Having access to
analytical functions inside the loss function acts as a regularizer, enforcing
robust behavior for parametric uncertainties. On the other hand, a regular data
loss is used for adapting to residual disturbances (non-parametric
uncertainties), unaccounted during mathematical modelling. Experiments are
performed in a simulated environment for trajectory tracking of a quadrotor. We

normalized 3D face texture maps (diffuse, normal, roughness, and specular) by
an image-translation network. Consequently, reconstructed 3D face textures
without undesirable information will significantly benefit subsequent
processes, such as re-lighting or re-makeup. In experiments, we show that
BareSkinNet outperforms state-of-the-art makeup removal methods. In addition,
our method is remarkably helpful in removing makeup to generate consistent
high-fidelity texture maps, which makes it extendable to many realistic face

guide the algorithm's performance. In this study we propose methods for
fine-tuning and calibrating DRL-based policies so that they can meet multiple

recognition (FR) applications from presentation attacks. FR performance has
been shown to be unfair to certain demographic and non-demographic groups.
However, the fairness of face PAD is an understudied issue, mainly due to the
lack of appropriately annotated data. To address this issue, this work first
presents a Combined Attribute Annotated PAD Dataset (CAAD-PAD) by combining
several well-known PAD datasets where we provide seven human-annotated

of face PADs and its relation to the nature of training data and the
Operational Decision Threshold Assignment (ODTA) on different data groups by
studying four face PAD approaches on our CAAD-PAD. To simultaneously represent
both the PAD fairness and the absolute PAD performance, we introduce a novel
metric, namely the Accuracy Balanced Fairness (ABF). Extensive experiments on
CAAD-PAD show that the training data and ODTA induce unfairness on gender,
occlusion, and other attribute groups. Based on these analyses, we propose a
data augmentation method, FairSWAP, which aims to disrupt the identity/semantic
information and guide models to mine attack cues rather than attribute-related
information. Detailed experimental results demonstrate that FairSWAP generally
enhances both the PAD performance and the fairness of face PAD.

analyze the approximation error of the corresponding linearized PDE (Stokes)
system, where the simple front-tracking technique is used to update the slow
moving boundary. An effective multiscale method is then designed based on the

retrieval. This task is of particular interest as 2D sketches were shown to be
effective queries for 2D images. However, due to the domain gap, it remains
hard to achieve strong performance in 3D shape retrieval from 2D sketches.
Recent work demonstrated the advantage of 3D VR sketching on this task. In our
work, we focus on the challenge caused by inherent inaccuracies in 3D VR
sketches. We observe that retrieval results obtained with a triplet loss with a
fixed margin value, commonly used for retrieval tasks, contain many irrelevant
shapes and often just one or few with a similar structure to the query. To
mitigate this problem, we for the first time draw a connection between adaptive
margin values and shape similarities. In particular, we propose to use a
triplet loss with an adaptive margin value driven by a ""fitting gap"", which is
the similarity of two shapes under structure-preserving deformations. We also
conduct a user study which confirms that this fitting gap is indeed a suitable
criterion to evaluate the structural similarity of shapes. Furthermore, we

learning tasks is typically even lower. This suggests that the colors diverge
too fast, defining a similarity that is too coarse. We generalize the concept

refinement, which allows a slower convergence to the stable coloring and thus
provides a more fine-grained refinement hierarchy and vertex similarity. We
assign new colors by clustering vertex neighborhoods, replacing the original

shared blackboard communication model with vertex-partitioned inputs. There are
$n$ players corresponding to vertices of an undirected graph, and each player
sees the edges incident on its vertex -- this way, each edge is known by both
its endpoints and is thus shared by two players. The players communicate in
simultaneous rounds by posting their messages on a shared blackboard visible to
all players, with the goal of computing an MIS of the graph. While the MIS
problem is well studied in other distributed models, and while shared
blackboard is, perhaps, the simplest broadcast model, lower bounds for our
problem were only known against one-round protocols.
  We present a lower bound on the round-communication tradeoff for computing an
MIS in this model. Specifically, we show that when $r$ rounds of interaction
are allowed, at least one player needs to communicate $\Omega(n^{1/20^{r+1}})$
bits. In particular, with logarithmic bandwidth, finding an MIS requires
$\Omega(\log\log{n})$ rounds. This lower bound can be compared with the
algorithm of Ghaffari, Gouleakis, Konrad, Mitrovi\'c, and Rubinfeld [PODC 2018]
that solves MIS in $O(\log\log{n})$ rounds but with a logarithmic bandwidth for
an average player. Additionally, our lower bound further extends to the closely
related problem of maximal bipartite matching.
  To prove our results, we devise a new round elimination framework, which we
call partial-input embedding, that may also be useful in future work for
proving round-sensitive lower bounds in the presence of edge-sharing between
players.
  Finally, we discuss several implications of our results to multi-round
(adaptive) distributed sketching algorithms, broadcast congested clique, and to
the welfare maximization problem in two-sided matching markets.

human interactions, going beyond raw prediction accuracy. Concept bottleneck
models promote trustworthiness by conditioning classification tasks on an
intermediate level of human-like concepts. This enables human interventions
which can correct mispredicted concepts to improve the model's performance.
However, existing concept bottleneck models are unable to find optimal
compromises between high task accuracy, robust concept-based explanations, and
effective interventions on concepts -- particularly in real-world conditions
where complete and accurate concept supervisions are scarce. To address this,
we propose Concept Embedding Models, a novel family of concept bottleneck
models which goes beyond the current accuracy-vs-interpretability trade-off by
learning interpretable high-dimensional concept representations. Our
experiments demonstrate that Concept Embedding Models (1) attain better or
competitive task accuracy w.r.t. standard neural models without concepts, (2)
provide concept representations capturing meaningful semantics including and
beyond their ground truth labels, (3) support test-time concept interventions
whose effect in test accuracy surpasses that in standard concept bottleneck
models, and (4) scale to real-world conditions where complete concept
supervisions are scarce.

procedure, such as the order of training data or the particular exploratory
actions taken by agents. A training procedure has high IR when the agents it
produces take very similar actions under intervention, despite variation in
these incidental aspects of the training procedure. We develop an intuitive,
quantitative measure of IR and calculate it for eight algorithms in three Atari
environments across dozens of interventions and states. From these experiments,
we find that IR varies with the amount of training and type of algorithm and
that high performance does not imply high IR, as one might expect.

it is possible to determine the potential demand by the visitor's

  arXiv:2111.05222",,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Automatic emotion recognition (ER) has recently gained lot of interest due to
its potential in many real-world applications. In this context, multimodal
approaches have been shown to improve performance (over unimodal approaches) by
combining diverse and complementary sources of information, providing some
robustness to noisy and missing modalities. In this paper, we focus on
dimensional ER based on the fusion of facial and vocal modalities extracted
from videos, where complementary audio-visual (A-V) relationships are explored
to predict an individual's emotional states in valence-arousal space. Most
state-of-the-art fusion techniques rely on recurrent networks or conventional
attention mechanisms that do not effectively leverage the complementary nature
of A-V modalities. To address this problem, we introduce a joint
cross-attentional model for A-V fusion that extracts the salient features
across A-V modalities, that allows to effectively leverage the inter-modal
relationships, while retaining the intra-modal relationships. In particular, it
computes the cross-attention weights based on correlation between the joint
feature representation and that of the individual modalities. By deploying the
joint A-V feature representation into the cross-attention module, it helps to
simultaneously leverage both the intra and inter modal relationships, thereby
significantly improving the performance of the system over the vanilla
cross-attention module. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated
experimentally on challenging videos from the RECOLA and AffWild2 datasets.
Results indicate that our joint cross-attentional A-V fusion model provides a
cost-effective solution that can outperform state-of-the-art approaches, even
when the modalities are noisy or absent.

  Representations using Transformer Encoder","10 pages, 7 figures",,,,cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Numerical interpolation for scattered data aims to estimate values for target
points based on those of some observed points. Traditional approaches produce
estimations through constructing an interpolation function that combines
multiple basis functions. These approaches require the basis functions to be
pre-defined explicitly, thus greatly limiting their applications in practical
scenarios. Recent advances exhibit an alternative strategy that learns
interpolation functions directly from observed points using machine learning
techniques, say deep neural networks. This strategy, although promising, cannot
effectively exploit the correlations between observed points and target points
as it treats these types of points separately. Here, we present a
learning-based approach to numerical interpolation using encoder
representations of Transformers (thus called NIERT). NIERT treats the value of
each target point as a masked token, which enables processing target points and
observed points in a unified fashion. By calculating the partial self-attention
between target points and observed points at each layer, NIERT gains advantages
of exploiting the correlations among these points and, more importantly,
avoiding the unexpected interference of target points on observed points. NIERT
also uses the pre-training technique to further improve its accuracy. On three
representative datasets, including two synthetic datasets and a real-world
dataset, NIERT outperforms the existing approaches, e.g., on the TFRD-ADlet
dataset for temperature field reconstruction, NIERT achieves an MAE of
$1.897\times 10^{-3}$, substantially better than the transformer-based approach
(MAE: $27.074\times 10^{-3}$). These results clearly demonstrate the accuracy
of NIERT and its potential to apply in multiple practical fields.

past, mathematicians have developed several numerical techniques to approximate
the values of definite integrals, but primitives or indefinite integrals are
often non-elementary. Anti-derivatives are necessarily required when there are
several parameters in an integrand and the integral obtained is a function of
those parameters. There is no theoretical method that can do this for any given
function. Some existing ways to get around this are primarily based on either
curve fitting or infinite series approximation of the integrand, which is then
integrated theoretically. Curve fitting approximations are inaccurate for
highly non-linear functions and require a different approach for every problem.
On the other hand, the infinite series approach does not give a closed-form
solution, and their truncated forms are often inaccurate. We claim that using a
single method for all integrals, our algorithm can approximate anti-derivatives
to any required accuracy. We have used this algorithm to obtain the
anti-derivatives of several functions, including non-elementary and oscillatory

in particular, and sentient agents in general, with the single imperative of
minimizing free energy. As such, it provides a computational account for

However, the exact specification of the generative model and the hidden state
space structure is left to the experimenter, whose design choices influence the

proposed to learn a hidden state space structure purely from data, alleviating
the experimenter from this tedious design task, but resulting in an entangled,
non-interpreteable state space. In this paper, we hypothesize that such a
learnt, entangled state space does not necessarily yield the best model in

and are difficult to inspect. Interpretable machine learning models can aid in
discovering patterns in data as well as give easy-to-understand insights to
domain specialists. In this study, we present Neuro-Symbolic Time Series
Classification (NSTSC), a neuro-symbolic model that leverages signal temporal
logic (STL) and neural network (NN) to accomplish TSC tasks using multi-view
data representation and expresses the model as a human-readable, interpretable
formula. In NSTSC, each neuron is linked to a symbolic expression, i.e., an STL
(sub)formula. The output of NSTSC is thus interpretable as an STL formula akin
to natural language, describing temporal and logical relations hidden in the
data. We propose an NSTSC-based classifier that adopts a decision-tree approach
to learn formula structures and accomplish a multiclass TSC task. The proposed
smooth activation functions for wSTL allow the model to be learned in an
end-to-end fashion. We test NSTSC on a real-world wound healing dataset from
mice and benchmark datasets from the UCR time-series repository, demonstrating
that NSTSC achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art models.
Furthermore, NSTSC can generate interpretable formulas that match with domain
knowledge.

the scene into different concepts (e.g. shape and position of an object) and
learning the respective laws of these concepts which may be either natural
(e.g. laws of motion) or man-made (e.g. laws of a game). The automatic parsing
of these laws indicates the model's ability to understand the scene, which
makes law parsing play a central role in many visual tasks. In this paper, we
propose a deep latent variable model for Compositional LAw Parsing (CLAP). CLAP
achieves the human-like compositionality ability through an encoding-decoding
architecture to represent concepts in the scene as latent variables, and
further employ concept-specific random functions, instantiated with Neural
Processes, in the latent space to capture the law on each concept. Our
experimental results demonstrate that CLAP outperforms the compared baseline
methods in multiple visual tasks including intuitive physics, abstract visual
reasoning, and scene representation. In addition, CLAP can learn
concept-specific laws in a scene without supervision and one can edit laws
through modifying the corresponding latent random functions, validating its
interpretability and manipulability.

related classes. Existing research focuses primarily on utilizing the labeled
set at the methodological level, with less emphasis on the analysis of the
labeled set itself. Thus, in this paper, we rethink novel class discovery from
the labeled set and focus on two core questions: (i) Given a specific unlabeled
set, what kind of labeled set can best support novel class discovery? (ii) A
fundamental premise of NCD is that the labeled set must be related to the
unlabeled set, but how can we measure this relation? For (i), we propose and
substantiate the hypothesis that NCD could benefit more from a labeled set with
a large degree of semantic similarity to the unlabeled set. Specifically, we
establish an extensive and large-scale benchmark with varying degrees of
semantic similarity between labeled/unlabeled datasets on ImageNet by
leveraging its hierarchical class structure. As a sharp contrast, the existing
NCD benchmarks are developed based on labeled sets with different number of
categories and images, and completely ignore the semantic relation. For (ii),
we introduce a mathematical definition for quantifying the semantic similarity
between labeled and unlabeled sets. In addition, we use this metric to confirm
the validity of our proposed benchmark and demonstrate that it highly
correlates with NCD performance. Furthermore, without quantitative analysis,
previous works commonly believe that label information is always beneficial.
However, counterintuitively, our experimental results show that using labels
may lead to sub-optimal outcomes in low-similarity settings.

need novel design to provide satisfactory services to the emerging

the robustness of xURLLC, this paper proposes a robust beamforming and
rate-splitting design in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime for downlink
multi-user multi-antenna xURLLC systems. In the design, adaptive rate-splitting
is introduced to flexibly handle the complex inter-user interference and thus
improve the spectrum efficiency. Taking the imperfection of the channel state
information at the transmitter (CSIT) into consideration, a max-min user rate
problem is formulated to optimize the common and private beamforming vectors
and the rate-splitting vector under the premise of ensuring the requirements of
transmission latency and reliability of all the users. The optimization problem
is intractable due to the non-convexity of the constraint set and the infinite
constraints caused by CSIT uncertainties. To solve it, we convert the infinite
constraints into finite ones by the S-Procedure method and transform the
original problem into a difference of convex (DC) programming. A constrained
concave convex procedure (CCCP) and the Gaussian randomization based iterative
algorithm is proposed to obtain a local minimum. Simulation results confirm the
convergence, robustness and effectiveness of the proposed robust beamforming
and rate-splitting design in the FBL regime. It is also shown that the proposed
robust design achieves considerable performance gain in the worst user rate

investigate the application of classical machine learning (ML) methods to
create an adequate and robust approach for obtaining boundary conditions (BCs)
from Doppler Echocardiography images, for haemodynamic modeling using CFD.
  Methods- Our proposed approach combines ML and CFD to model haemodynamic flow
within the region of interest. With the key feature of the approach being the
use of ML models to calibrate the inlet and outlet boundary conditions (BCs) of
the CFD model. The key input variable for the ML model was the patients heart
rate as this was the parameter that varied in time across the measured vessels
within the study. ANSYS Fluent was used for the CFD component of the study
whilst the scikit-learn python library was used for the ML component.
  Results- We validated our approach against a real clinical case of severe CoA
before intervention. The maximum coarctation velocity of our simulations were
compared to the measured maximum coarctation velocity obtained from the patient
whose geometry is used within the study. Of the 5 ML models used to obtain BCs
the top model was within 5\% of the measured maximum coarctation velocity.
  Conclusion- The framework demonstrated that it was capable of taking
variations of the patients heart rate between measurements into account. Thus,
enabling the calculation of BCs that were physiologically realistic when the
heart rate was scaled across each vessel whilst providing a reasonably accurate
solution.

the drawback of being inherently opaque. At the same time, the concealing of a
model's inner workings often hinders its real-world application. This
observation holds particularly true in financial audits since auditors must
reasonably explain and justify their audit decisions. Nowadays, various
Explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been proposed to address this challenge,
e.g., SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). However, in unsupervised DL as
often applied in financial audits, these methods explain the model output at
the level of encoded variables. As a result, the explanations of Autoencoder
Neural Networks (AENNs) are often hard to comprehend by human auditors. To
mitigate this drawback, we propose (RESHAPE), which explains the model output
on an aggregated attribute-level. In addition, we introduce an evaluation
framework to compare the versatility of XAI methods in auditing. Our
experimental results show empirical evidence that RESHAPE results in versatile
explanations compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We envision such
attribute-level explanations as a necessary next step in the adoption of
unsupervised DL techniques in financial auditing.

functions has been an active area of research in the field of machine learning.
Prior work has shown that the noise of stochastic gradient descent improves
optimization by overcoming undesirable obstacles in the landscape. Moreover,
injecting artificial Gaussian noise has become a popular idea to quickly escape
saddle points. Indeed, in the absence of reliable gradient information, the
noise is used to explore the landscape, but it is unclear what type of noise is
optimal in terms of exploration ability. In order to narrow this gap in our
knowledge, we study a general type of continuous-time non-Markovian process,
based on fractional Brownian motion, that allows for the increments of the
process to be correlated. This generalizes processes based on Brownian motion,
such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We demonstrate how to discretize such
processes which gives rise to the new algorithm fPGD. This method is a
generalization of the known algorithms PGD and Anti-PGD. We study the
properties of fPGD both theoretically and empirically, demonstrating that it
possesses exploration abilities that, in some cases, are favorable over PGD and
Anti-PGD. These results open the field to novel ways to exploit noise for
training machine learning models.

unsupervised-learning method for heat, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC)
load disaggregation using low-resolution (e.g., 15 minutes) smart meter data.
We first demonstrate that electricity consumption profiles on mild-temperature
days can be used to estimate the non-HVAC base load on hot days. A residual
load profile can then be calculated by subtracting the mild-day load profile
from the hot-day load profile. The residual load profiles are processed using
ICA for HVAC load extraction. An optimization-based algorithm is proposed for
post-adjustment of the ICA results, considering two bounding factors for
enhancing the robustness of the ICA algorithm. First, we use the hourly HVAC
energy bounds computed based on the relationship between HVAC load and
temperature to remove unrealistic HVAC load spikes. Second, we exploit the
dependency between the daily nocturnal and diurnal loads extracted from
historical meter data to smooth the base load profile. Pecan Street data with
sub-metered HVAC data were used to test and validate the proposed
methods.Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method is
computationally efficient and robust across multiple customers.

consider the deployment population. When the population of patients with

be misleading. In this study we describe three classes of label selection and
simulate five causally distinct scenarios to assess how particular selection
mechanisms bias a suite of commonly reported binary machine learning model
performance metrics. Simulations reveal that when selection is affected by
observed features, naive estimates of model discrimination may be misleading.
When selection is affected by labels, naive estimates of calibration fail to
reflect reality. We borrow traditional weighting estimators from causal
inference literature and find that when selection probabilities are properly
specified, they recover full population estimates. We then tackle the
real-world task of monitoring the performance of deployed machine learning

means, and the means of different classes exhibit a certain tight frame
structure, which is also aligned with the last layer's classifier. As feature
normalization in the last layer becomes a common practice in modern

collapse phenomenon for normalized features. Based on an unconstrained feature
model, we simplify the empirical loss function in a multi-class classification
task into a nonconvex optimization problem over the Riemannian manifold by
constraining all features and classifiers over the sphere. In this context, we
analyze the nonconvex landscape of the Riemannian optimization problem over the

critical points are strict saddles with negative curvature. Experimental

deep variation prior (DVP), which states that the variation of a properly
learnt denoiser with respect to the change of noise satisfies some smoothness
properties, as a key criterion for good denoisers. Building upon DVP, an
unsupervised deep learning framework, that simultaneously learns a denoiser and
estimates noise variances, is developed. Our method does not require any clean
training images or an external step of noise estimation, and instead,
approximates the minimum mean squared error denoisers using only a set of noisy
images. With the two underlying tasks being considered in a single framework,
we allow them to be optimised for each other. The experimental results show a
denoising quality comparable to that of supervised learning and accurate noise
variance estimates.

or even the contact between two bones at our knee joints. The ability to
naturally measure and monitor these contact forces allows a plethora of
applications from warehouse management (detect faulty packages based on
weights) to robotics (making a robotic arms' grip as sensitive as human skin)
and healthcare (knee-implants). It is challenging to design a ubiquitous force
sensor that can be used naturally for all these applications. First, the sensor
should be small enough to fit in narrow spaces. Next, we don't want to lay
cumbersome cables to read the force values from the sensors. Finally, we need
to have a battery-free design to meet the in-vivo applications. We develop
WiForceSticker, a wireless, battery-free, sticker-like force sensor that can be
ubiquitously deployed on any surface, such as all warehouse packages, robotic
arms, and knee joints. WiForceSticker first designs a tiny
$4$~mm~$\times$~$2$~mm~$\times$~$0.4$~mm capacitative sensor design equipped
with a $10$~mm~$\times$~$10$~mm antenna designed on a flexible PCB substrate.
Secondly, it introduces a new mechanism to transduce the force information on
ambient RF radiations that can be read by a remotely located reader wirelessly
without requiring any battery or active components at the force sensor, by
interfacing the sensors with COTS RFID systems. The sensor can detect forces in
the range of $0$-$6$~N with sensing accuracy of $<0.5$~N across multiple
testing environments and evaluated with over $10,000$ varying force level
presses on the sensor. We also showcase two application case studies with our
designed sensors, weighing warehouse packages and sensing forces applied by
bone joints.

domain adaptation framework via generating reliable pseudo ground truths of

two mechanisms for pseudo-labeling: 1) 2D-based pseudo-labels via measuring the
consistency of depth predictions when images are with the same content but
different styles; 2) 3D-aware pseudo-labels via a point cloud completion
network that learns to complete the depth values in the 3D space, thus
providing more structural information in a scene to refine and generate more
reliable pseudo-labels. In experiments, we show that our pseudo-labeling
methods improve depth estimation in various settings, including the usage of
stereo pairs during training. Furthermore, the proposed method performs
favorably against several state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation

adapt online at test time not only to the disturbances applied to the drone,
but also to the robot dynamics and hardware in the same framework. We achieve
this by training a neural network to estimate a latent representation of the
robot and environment parameters, which is used to condition the behaviour of
the controller, also represented as a neural network. We train both networks
exclusively in simulation with the goal of flying the quadcopters to goal
positions and avoiding crashes to the ground. We directly deploy the same
controller trained in the simulation without any modifications on two
quadcopters with differences in mass, inertia, and maximum motor speed of up to
4 times. In addition, we show rapid adaptation to sudden and large disturbances
(up to 35.7%) in the mass and inertia of the quadcopters. We perform an
extensive evaluation in both simulation and the physical world, where we
outperform a state-of-the-art learning-based adaptive controller and a
traditional PID controller specifically tuned to each platform individually.

transformer-based architectures. To address this issue, we reformulate the
cross-attention in a video transformer through the lens of kernel and apply two
kinds of temporal smoothing kernel: A box kernel or a Laplace kernel. The
resulting streaming attention reuses much of the computation from frame to
frame, and only requires a constant time update each frame. Based on this idea,
we build TeSTra, a Temporal Smoothing Transformer, that takes in arbitrarily
long inputs with constant caching and computing overhead. Specifically, it runs

existing DSSL algorithms cannot cope with data uncertainties and may suffer
from high computation and communication overhead problems. To handle these
issues, we propose a distributed semi-supervised fuzzy regression (DSFR) model
with fuzzy if-then rules and interpolation consistency regularization (ICR).
The ICR, which was proposed recently for semi-supervised problem, can force
decision boundaries to pass through sparse data areas, thus increasing model
robustness. However, its application in distributed scenarios has not been
considered yet. In this work, we proposed a distributed Fuzzy C-means (DFCM)
method and a distributed interpolation consistency regularization (DICR) built
on the well-known alternating direction method of multipliers to respectively
locate parameters in antecedent and consequent components of DSFR. Notably, the
DSFR model converges very fast since it does not involve back-propagation

a novel graph pooling layer, Self-Attention based Node and Edge pool

Here, we show how data can be denoised via a deep convolutional neural network
such that weak signals appear with quantitative accuracy. In particular, we
study X-ray diffraction on crystalline materials. We demonstrate that weak
signals stemming from charge ordering, insignificant in the noisy data, become
visible and accurate in the denoised data. This success is enabled by
supervised training of a deep neural network with pairs of measured low- and
high-noise data. This way, the neural network learns about the statistical
properties of the noise. We demonstrate that using artificial noise (such as
Poisson and Gaussian) does not yield such quantitatively accurate results. Our
approach thus illustrates a practical strategy for noise filtering that can be

of periodic sequences of the roots of unity in constructing a recursive
procedure for representing and computing the prime numbers. The nth wave number
${\bf u}_n$ is the countable sequence of the nth roots of unity having
frequencies k/n for all integer phases k. The space U is closed under a
commutative and associative binary operation ${\bf u}_m \odot{\bf u}_n={\bf
u}_{mn}$, termed the circular product, and is isomorphic with N under their
respective product operators. Functions are defined on U that partition wave
numbers into two complementary sequences, of which the co-number $ {\overset
{\bf \ast }{ \bf u}}_n$ is a function of a wave number in which zeros replace
its positive roots of unity. The recursive procedure $ {\overset {\bf \ast }{
\bf U}}_{N+1}= {\overset {\bf \ast }{ \bf U}}_{N}\odot{\overset {\bf \ast }{\bf
u}}_{{N+1}}$ represents prime numbers explicitly in terms of preceding prime
numbers, starting with $p_1=2$, and is shown never to terminate. If ${p}_1, ...

$p_{N+1} \leq k < p^2_{N+1}$ that are associated with the non-zero terms of $

approximately $7^{2(N-1)}/(2(N-1)ln7)$ primes at each iteration for $ N>1$.
When the phases of wave numbers are represented in modular arithmetic, the
prime phases are representable in terms of sums of reciprocals of the initial
set of prime phases and have a relation with the zeta-function.

changing ecosystem that can affect longrunning services, potentially inducing
biases and obscurities into ongoing data collection means. Frequent analyses
but also updates are necessary to enable a valuable service to the community.
  In this paper, we show that the existing hitlist is highly impacted by the
Great Firewall of China, and we offer a cleaned view on the development of
responsive addresses. While the accumulated input shows an increasing bias
towards some networks, the cleaned set of responsive addresses is well
distributed and shows a steady increase.
  Although it is a best practice to remove aliased prefixes from IPv6 hitlists,
we show that this also removes major content delivery networks. More than 98%
of all IPv6 addresses announced by Fastly were labeled as aliased and
Cloudflare prefixes hosting more than 10M domains were excluded. Depending on
the hitlist usage, e.g., higher layer protocol scans, inclusion of addresses
from these providers can be valuable.
  Lastly, we evaluate different new address candidate sources, including target
generation algorithms to improve the coverage of the current IPv6 Hitlist. We
show that a combination of different methodologies is able to identify 5.6M
new, responsive addresses. This accounts for an increase by 174% and combined
with the current IPv6 Hitlist, we identify 8.8M responsive addresses.

  within the QAnon Conspiracy on Twitter","12 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables",,,,cs.SI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Social media provide a fertile ground where conspiracy theories and radical
ideas can flourish, reach broad audiences, and sometimes lead to hate or
violence beyond the online world itself. QAnon represents a notable example of
a political conspiracy that started out on social media but turned mainstream,
in part due to public endorsement by influential political figures. Nowadays,
QAnon conspiracies often appear in the news, are part of political rhetoric,
and are espoused by significant swaths of people in the United States. It is
therefore crucial to understand how such a conspiracy took root online, and
what led so many social media users to adopt its ideas. In this work, we
propose a framework that exploits both social interaction and content signals
to uncover evidence of user radicalization or support for QAnon. Leveraging a
large dataset of 240M tweets collected in the run-up to the 2020 US
Presidential election, we define and validate a multivariate metric of
radicalization. We use that to separate users in distinct, naturally-emerging,
classes of behaviors associated to radicalization processes, from self-declared
QAnon supporters to hyper-active conspiracy promoters. We also analyze the
impact of Twitter's moderation policies on the interactions among different
classes: we discover aspects of moderation that succeed, yielding a substantial
reduction in the endorsement received by hyper-active QAnon accounts. But we
also uncover where moderation fails, showing how QAnon content amplifiers are
not deterred or affected by Twitter intervention. Our findings refine our
understanding of online radicalization processes, reveal effective and
ineffective aspects of moderation, and call for the need to further investigate
the role social media play in the spread of conspiracies.

different datasets without any specific training. This objective function can
actually be derived from a form of spectral clustering applied to the entire

measured in terms of the energy efficiency. We perform a theoretical analysis
of the properties of the reward function design, and empirically evaluate the
impact of using certain observation and action spaces on a variety of
scenarios, with the reward function and energy usage as metrics. We show that
directly using the neighboring agents' information as observation generally
outperforms the more widely used raycasting. Similarly, using nonholonomic
controls with egocentric observations tends to produce more efficient behaviors
than holonomic controls with absolute observations. Each of these choices has a
significant, and potentially nontrivial impact on the results, and so
researchers should be mindful about choosing and reporting them in their work.

challenging due to the large domain shift in data distributions between RGB and

considered as privileged information (PI) that is unavailable at test time, and
allows formulating this cross-modal matching task as a problem in learning
under privileged information (LUPI). We devised a new method to generate images
between visible and infrared domains that provide additional information to
train a deep ReID model through an intermediate domain adaptation. In
particular, by employing color-free and multi-step triplet loss objectives
during training, our method provides common feature representation spaces that
are robust to large visible-infrared domain shifts. % Experimental results on
challenging visible-infrared ReID datasets indicate that our proposed approach
consistently improves matching accuracy, without any computational overhead at

bidirectional data flow. In this paper we observe that the denotational
definition of optics - identifying two optics as equivalent by observing their
behaviour from the outside - is not suitable for operational, software oriented
approaches where optics are not merely observed, but built with their internal
setups in mind. We identify operational differences between denotationally
isomorphic categories of cartesian optics and lenses: their different
composition rule and corresponding space-time tradeoffs, positioning them at
two opposite ends of a spectrum. With these motivations we lift the existing
categorical constructions and their relationships to the 2-categorical level,
showing that the relevant operational concerns become visible. We define the
2-category $\textbf{2-Optic}(\mathcal{C})$ whose 2-cells explicitly track
optics' internal configuration. We show that the 1-category
$\textbf{Optic}(\mathcal{C})$ arises by locally quotienting out the connected
components of this 2-category. We show that the embedding of lenses into
cartesian optics gets weakened from a functor to an oplax functor whose
oplaxator now detects the different composition rule. We determine the
difficulties in showing this functor forms a part of an adjunction in any of
the standard 2-categories. We establish a conjecture that the well-known
isomorphism between cartesian lenses and optics arises out of the lax
2-adjunction between their double-categorical counterparts. In addition to
presenting new research, this paper is also meant to be an accessible

case of Rx help and all channel configurations, the rate-limited help results
in a secrecy capacity boost equal to the help rate irrespective of whether the
help is secure or not, so that the secrecy of help does not provide any
capacity increase. The secrecy capacity is positive for the reversely-degraded
channel (where the no-help secrecy capacity is zero) and no wiretap coding is
needed to achieve it. More noise at the legitimate receiver can sometimes
result in higher secrecy capacity. The secrecy capacity with Rx help is not
increased even if the helper is aware of the message being transmitted. The
same secrecy capacity boost also holds if non-secure help is available to the
transmitter (encoder), in addition to or instead of the same Rx help, so that,
in the case of the joint Tx/Rx help, one help link can be omitted without

the boost in the secrecy capacity is the sum of help rates and no link can be

algorithms aim to accomplish VFI by using only keyframes, which is an ill-posed
problem since the keyframes usually do not yield any accurate precision about
the trajectories of the objects in the scene. On the other hand, event-based
cameras provide more precise information between the keyframes of a video. Some
recent state-of-the-art event-based methods approach this problem by utilizing
event data for better optical flow estimation to interpolate for video frame by
warping. Nonetheless, those methods heavily suffer from the ghosting effect. On
the other hand, some of kernel-based VFI methods that only use frames as input,
have shown that deformable convolutions, when backed up with transformers, can
be a reliable way of dealing with long-range dependencies. We propose
event-based video frame interpolation with attention (E-VFIA), as a lightweight

generating crispier frames. The simulation results show that the proposed

vocabulary of discrete substructure patterns induced over drug sets is not
dramatically large due to the limited set of atom types and constraints on
bonding patterns enforced by chemistry. Under this pretext, we explore the
effectiveness of distributed representations of the molecular graphs of drugs
in drug pair scoring tasks such as drug synergy, polypharmacy, and drug-drug
interaction prediction. To achieve this, we present a methodology for learning
and incorporating distributed representations of graphs within a unified
framework for drug pair scoring. Subsequently, we augment a number of recent
and state-of-the-art models to utilise our embeddings. We empirically show that
the incorporation of these embeddings improves downstream performance of almost
every model across different drug pair scoring tasks, even those the original
model was not designed for. We publicly release all of our drug embeddings for
the DrugCombDB, DrugComb, DrugbankDDI, and TwoSides datasets.

segmentation are usually implemented in specialized networks with distinctive
architectures that are difficult to adapt to each other. This paper presents
LidarMultiNet, a LiDAR-based multi-task network that unifies these three major
LiDAR perception tasks. Among its many benefits, a multi-task network can
reduce the overall cost by sharing weights and computation among multiple
tasks. However, it typically underperforms compared to independently combined
single-task models. The proposed LidarMultiNet aims to bridge the performance
gap between the multi-task network and multiple single-task networks. At the
core of LidarMultiNet is a strong 3D voxel-based encoder-decoder architecture
with a Global Context Pooling (GCP) module extracting global contextual
features from a LiDAR frame. Task-specific heads are added on top of the
network to perform the three LiDAR perception tasks. More tasks can be
implemented simply by adding new task-specific heads while introducing little
additional cost. A second stage is also proposed to refine the first-stage
segmentation and generate accurate panoptic segmentation results. LidarMultiNet
is extensively tested on both Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes dataset,
demonstrating for the first time that major LiDAR perception tasks can be
unified in a single strong network that is trained end-to-end and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Notably, LidarMultiNet reaches the official 1st
place in the Waymo Open Dataset 3D semantic segmentation challenge 2022 with
the highest mIoU and the best accuracy for most of the 22 classes on the test
set, using only LiDAR points as input. It also sets the new state-of-the-art
for a single model on the Waymo 3D object detection benchmark and three
nuScenes benchmarks.

factor-as-piece approximation that divides the linear-chain graph structure

automatic prompting method: (1) We adopt natural language prompts on
sequence-to-sequence models, enabling free-form generation and larger label
search space; (2) We propose label sequences -- phrases with indefinite lengths
to verbalize the labels -- which eliminate the need of manual templates and are
more expressive than single label words; (3) We use beam search to

freedom of the agent in selecting the next available nodes at each step. We
assume the graph structure is fully available, but the reward distributions are
unknown. Built upon an offline graph-based planning algorithm and the principle
of optimism, we design an online learning algorithm that balances long-term
exploration-exploitation using the principle of optimism. We show that our
proposed algorithm achieves $O(|S|\sqrt{T}\log(T)+D|S|\log T)$ learning regret,
where $|S|$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter of the graph, which
is superior compared to the best-known reinforcement learning algorithms under
similar settings. Numerical experiments confirm that our algorithm outperforms
several benchmarks. Finally, we present a synthetic robotic application modeled
by the graph bandit framework, where a robot moves on a network of
rural/suburban locations to provide high-speed internet access using our
proposed algorithm.

using the same R-D (Rate-Distortion) trade-off parameter $\lambda$ for all
frames are suboptimal, which brings the need for bit allocation. Unlike
previous methods based on heuristic and empirical R-D models, we propose to
solve this problem by gradient-based optimization. Specifically, we first
propose a continuous bit implementation method based on Semi-Amortized
Variational Inference (SAVI). Then, we propose a pixel-level implicit bit
allocation method using iterative optimization by changing the SAVI target.
Moreover, we derive the precise R-D model based on the differentiable trait of
NVC. And we show the optimality of our method by proofing its equivalence to
the bit allocation with precise R-D model. Experimental results show that our
approach significantly improves NVC methods and outperforms existing bit
allocation methods. Our approach is plug-and-play for all differentiable NVC
methods, and it can be directly adopted on existing pre-trained models.

two important desiderata required of modern machine learning models. While
these two desiderata seem related, the connection between them is often unclear
in practice. Here, we discuss these connections through a causal lens, focusing
on anti-causal prediction tasks, where the input to a classifier (e.g., an
image) is assumed to be generated as a function of the target label and the
protected attribute. By taking this perspective, we draw explicit connections
between a common fairness criterion - separation - and a common notion of
robustness - risk invariance. These connections provide new motivation for
applying the separation criterion in anticausal settings, and inform old
discussions regarding fairness-performance tradeoffs. In addition, our findings
suggest that robustness-motivated approaches can be used to enforce separation,
and that they often work better in practice than methods designed to directly
enforce separation. Using a medical dataset, we empirically validate our
findings on the task of detecting pneumonia from X-rays, in a setting where
differences in prevalence across sex groups motivates a fairness mitigation.

privacy and security concerns. To mitigate these issues, secure multi-party
computation (MPC) has been discussed, to enable the privacy-preserving DL
computation. In practice, they often come at very high computation and
communication overhead, and potentially prohibit their popularity in large
scale systems. Two orthogonal research trends have attracted enormous interests
in addressing the energy efficiency in secure deep learning, i.e., overhead
reduction of MPC comparison protocol, and hardware acceleration. However, they
either achieve a low reduction ratio and suffer from high latency due to
limited computation and communication saving, or are power-hungry as existing
works mainly focus on general computing platforms such as CPUs and GPUs.
  In this work, as the first attempt, we develop a systematic framework,
PolyMPCNet, of joint overhead reduction of MPC comparison protocol and hardware
acceleration, by integrating hardware latency of the cryptographic building
block into the DNN loss function to achieve high energy efficiency, accuracy,
and security guarantee. Instead of heuristically checking the model sensitivity
after a DNN is well-trained (through deleting or dropping some non-polynomial
operators), our key design principle is to em enforce exactly what is assumed
in the DNN design -- training a DNN that is both hardware efficient and secure,
while escaping the local minima and saddle points and maintaining high
accuracy. More specifically, we propose a straight through polynomial
activation initialization method for cryptographic hardware friendly trainable
polynomial activation function to replace the expensive 2P-ReLU operator. We

Although most of existing methods have been proved to be effective, they are

probabilistic model is developed to jointly model sequential data and
annotators' expertise, in which categorical distribution is introduced to
estimate the reliability of each annotator in capturing local and non-local
label dependency for sequential annotation. To accelerate the marginalization
of the proposed model, a valid label sequence inference (VLSE) method is
proposed to derive the valid ground-truth label sequences from crowd sequential

level and further prunes sub-paths in the forward inference for label sequence
decoding. VLSE reduces the number of candidate label sequences and improves the

a Transformer-based sentence encoder through a contrastive objective with text,
i.e., clustering sentences with semantically similar meanings and scattering
others. In this work, we find the performance of Transformer models as sentence
encoders can be improved by training with multi-modal multi-task losses, using
unpaired examples from another modality (e.g., sentences and unrelated
image/audio data). In particular, besides learning by the contrastive loss on
text, our model clusters examples from a non-linguistic domain (e.g.,
visual/audio) with a similar contrastive loss at the same time. The reliance of
our framework on unpaired non-linguistic data makes it language-agnostic,
enabling it to be widely applicable beyond English NLP. Experiments on 7
semantic textual similarity benchmarks reveal that models trained with the
additional non-linguistic (images/audio) contrastive objective lead to higher
quality sentence embeddings. This indicates that Transformer models are able to
generalize better by doing a similar task (i.e., clustering) with unpaired

implement it in RTL on a TPU-like accelerator. Experiments on TPU-like

learn robust representations from the observations of the environment. In most
cases, the representations learned purely by the reinforcement learning loss
can differ vastly across states depending on how the value functions change.
However, the representations learned need not be very specific to the task at
hand. Relying only on the RL objective may yield representations that vary
greatly across successive time steps. In addition, since the RL loss has a
changing target, the representations learned would depend on how good the
current values/policies are. Thus, disentangling the representations from the
main task would allow them to focus more on capturing transition dynamics which
can improve generalization. To this end, we propose locally constrained
representations, where an auxiliary loss forces the state representations to be
predictable by the representations of the neighbouring states. This encourages
the representations to be driven not only by the value/policy learning but also
self-supervised learning, which constrains the representations from changing
too rapidly. We evaluate the proposed method on several known benchmarks and
observe strong performance. Especially in continuous control tasks, our

optimization of a control policy while minimizing regret w.r.t a baseline
policy performance. We present a joint imitation-reinforcement learning
framework, denoted JIRL. The learning process in JIRL assumes the availability
of a baseline policy and is designed with two objectives in mind \textbf{(a)}
leveraging the baseline's online demonstrations to minimize the regret w.r.t
the baseline policy during training, and \textbf{(b)} eventually surpassing the
baseline performance. JIRL addresses these objectives by initially learning to
imitate the baseline policy and gradually shifting control from the baseline to
an RL agent. Experimental results show that JIRL effectively accomplishes the
aforementioned objectives in several, continuous action-space domains. The
results demonstrate that JIRL is comparable to a state-of-the-art algorithm in
its final performance while incurring significantly lower baseline regret
during training in all of the presented domains. Moreover, the results show a
reduction factor of up to $21$ in baseline regret over a state-of-the-art
baseline regret minimization approach.

addition, the proposed algorithm ensures the feasibility of the optimization
problem and collision avoidance by adopting a linear safe corridor (LSC). We
verify that the proposed algorithm does not cause a deadlock in both random

homogenous across different cities and communities, and various heterogeneous
features can influence the spread trajectories. Hence, for predictive pandemic
monitoring, it is essential to explore latent heterogeneous features in cities
and communities that distinguish their specific pandemic spread trajectories.
To this end, this study creates a network embedding model capturing
cross-county visitation networks, as well as heterogeneous features to uncover
clusters of counties in the United States based on their pandemic spread
transmission trajectories. We collected and computed location intelligence
features from 2,787 counties from March 3 to June 29, 2020 (initial wave).
Second, we constructed a human visitation network, which incorporated county
features as node attributes, and visits between counties as network edges. Our
attributed network embeddings approach integrates both typological
characteristics of the cross-county visitation network, as well as
heterogeneous features. We conducted clustering analysis on the attributed
network embeddings to reveal four archetypes of spread risk trajectories
corresponding to four clusters of counties. Subsequently, we identified four
features as important features underlying the distinctive transmission risk
patterns among the archetypes. The attributed network embedding approach and
the findings identify and explain the non-homogenous pandemic risk trajectories
across counties for predictive pandemic monitoring. The study also contributes
to data-driven and deep learning-based approaches for pandemic analytics to
complement the standard epidemiological models for policy analysis in
pandemics.

introduces a model predictive control scheme, where a neural network constantly
updates the cost function of a quadratic program based on sensory inputs,
aiming to minimize a general non-convex task loss without solving a non-convex

Conventionally, learning-based automatic sleep scoring on single-channel

EEG signals is challenging owing to the following issues: 1) sleep-related EEG
patterns occur on different temporal and frequency scales and 2) sleep stages
share similar EEG patterns. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning

supervised contrastive learning for automatic sleep scoring. For the feature
pyramid, we propose a backbone network named SleePyCo-backbone to consider
multiple feature sequences on different temporal and frequency scales.
Supervised contrastive learning allows the network to extract class
discriminative features by minimizing the distance between intra-class features
and simultaneously maximizing that between inter-class features. Comparative
analyses on four public datasets demonstrate that SleePyCo consistently

models are roughly a dozen parameters with a realistic one requiring more than
100. Realistic radiative transfer models require tens of CPU minutes for a
single evaluation making the problem computationally intractable with
traditional means requiring millions of MCMC samples for such a problem. A new
method for accelerating simulations known as surrogate models or emulators

to understand progenitors/explosions from spectral time series. There exist
emulators for the TARDIS supernova radiative transfer code but they only
perform well on simplistic low-dimensional models (roughly a dozen parameters)

performant replicated distributed key-value stores (KVSs). However, existing
replication approaches do not work well when applied to PM KVSs: 1) Using RPC
induces software queueing and execution at backups, increasing request latency;
2) Using one-sided RDMA WRITE causes many streams of small PM writes, leading
to severe device-level write amplification (DLWA) on PM. In this paper, we
propose Rowan, an efficient RDMA abstraction to handle replication writes in PM
KVSs; it aggregates concurrent remote writes from different servers, and lands
these writes to PM in a sequential (thus low DLWA) and one-sided (thus low
latency) manner. We realize Rowan with off-the-shelf RDMA NICs. Further, we
build Rowan-KV, a log-structured PM KVS using Rowan for replication. Evaluation
shows that under write-intensive workloads, compared with PM KVSs using RPC and
RDMA WRITE for replication, Rowan-KV boosts throughput by 1.22X and 1.39X as
well as lowers median PUT latency by 1.77X and 2.11X, respectively, while

While there are already several tools for assisting with development of the
front end of compilers, tool support tapers off towards the back end, or
requires more background experience than is expected of undergraduate students.
  Structural operational semantics is a useful and mathematically simple
formalism for specifying the behaviour of programs and a specification lends
itself well to implementation; in particular big-step or natural semantics is
often a useful and simple approach. However, many students struggle with
learning the notation and often come up with ill-defined and meaningless
attempts at defining a structural operational semantics. A survey shows that
students working on programming language projects feel that tool support is
lacking and would be useful.
  Many of these problems encountered when developing a semantic definition are
similar to problems encountered in programming, in particular ones that are
essentially the result of type errors.
  We present a pedagogical metalanguage based on natural semantics, and its
implementation, as an attempt to marry two notions: a syntax similar to
textbook notation for natural semantics on the one hand, and automatic
verification of some correctness properties on the other by means of a strong
type discipline. The metalanguage and the tool provide the facilities for
writing and executing specifications as a form of programming. The user can
check that the specification is not meaningless as well as execute programs, if
the specification makes sense.

concept for modelling competitive resource allocation problems in distributed

agent has goals in terms of allocating certain resources. For MRAs it is
typically of importance that they are designed in a way such that there exists
a strategy that guarantees that all agents will achieve their goals. The
corresponding model checking problem is to determine whether such a winning
strategy exists or not, and the synthesis problem is to actually build the
strategy. While winning strategies ensure that all goals will be achieved,
following such strategies does not necessarily involve an optimal use of
resources.
  In this paper, we present a technique that allows to synthesise cost-optimal
solutions to distributed resource allocation problems. We consider a scenario
where system components such as agents and resources involve costs. A
multi-agent system shall be designed that is cost-minimal but still capable of
accomplishing a given set of goals. Our approach synthesises a winning strategy
that minimises the cumulative costs of the components that are required for
achieving the goals. The technique is based on a propositional logic encoding
and a reduction of the synthesis problem to the maximum satisfiability problem
(Max-SAT). Hence, a Max-SAT solver can be used to perform the synthesis. From a
truth assignment that maximises the number of satisfied clauses of the encoding
a cost-optimal winning strategy as well as a cost-optimal system can be
immediately derived.

sparsity to enable cost-effective continual learning on edge devices. SparCL
achieves both training acceleration and accuracy preservation through the
synergy of three aspects: weight sparsity, data efficiency, and gradient
sparsity. Specifically, we propose task-aware dynamic masking (TDM) to learn a
sparse network throughout the entire CL process, dynamic data removal (DDR) to
remove less informative training data, and dynamic gradient masking (DGM) to
sparsify the gradient updates. Each of them not only improves efficiency, but
also further mitigates catastrophic forgetting. SparCL consistently improves
the training efficiency of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) CL methods by at
most 23X less training FLOPs, and, surprisingly, further improves the SOTA
accuracy by at most 1.7%. SparCL also outperforms competitive baselines
obtained from adapting SOTA sparse training methods to the CL setting in both

volume schemes for the compressible Euler-Poisson (EP) equations in the
quasineutral limit is presented. As the quasineutral limit is singular for the
governing equations, the time discretisation is tantamount to achieving an
accurate numerical method. To this end, the EP system is viewed as a
differential algebraic equation system (DAEs) via the method of lines. As a
consequence of this vantage point, high order linearly semi-implicit (SI) time
discretisation are realised by employing a novel combination of the direct
approach used for implicit discretisation of DAEs and, two different classes of
IMEX-RK schemes: the additive and the multiplicative. For both the time
discretisation strategies, in order to account for rapid plasma oscillations in
quasineutral regimes, the nonlinear Euler fluxes are split into two different
combinations of stiff and non-stiff components. The high order scheme resulting
from the additive approach is designated as a classical scheme while the one
generated by the multiplicative approach possesses the asymptotic preserving
(AP) property. Time discretisations for the classical and the AP schemes are
performed by standard IMEX-RK and SI-IMEX-RK methods, respectively so that the
stiff terms are treated implicitly and the non-stiff ones explicitly. In order
to discretise in space a Rusanov-type central flux is used for the non-stiff

simultaneously with a team of robots: first, the guidance and navigation of
multiple robots to possibly different paths or surfaces typically embedded in
2D or 3D; second, their motion coordination while tracking their prescribed
paths or surfaces. The motion coordination is defined by desired parametric
displacements between robots on the path or surface. Such a desired
displacement is achieved by controlling the virtual coordinates, which
correspond to the path or surface's parameters, between guiding vector fields.
  Rigorous mathematical guarantees underpinned by dynamical systems theory and
Lyapunov theory are provided for the effective distributed motion coordination
and navigation of robots on paths or surfaces from all initial positions. As an
example for practical robotic applications, we derive a control algorithm from
the proposed coordinating guiding vector fields for a Dubins-car-like model
with actuation saturation.
  Our proposed algorithm is distributed and scalable to an arbitrary number of
robots. Furthermore, extensive illustrative simulations and fixed-wing aircraft
outdoor experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm.

Hanawal and Avinash Bhardwaj,Unsupervised Early Exit in DNNs with Multiple Exits,To be presented at International conference on AI-ML systems,,,,cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are generally designed as sequentially cascaded
differentiable blocks/layers with a prediction module connected only to its
last layer. DNNs can be attached with prediction modules at multiple points
along the backbone where inference can stop at an intermediary stage without
passing through all the modules. The last exit point may offer a better
prediction error but also involves more computational resources and latency. An
exit point that is `optimal' in terms of both prediction error and cost is
desirable. The optimal exit point may depend on the latent distribution of the
tasks and may change from one task type to another. During neural inference,
the ground truth of instances may not be available and error rates at each exit
point cannot be estimated. Hence one is faced with the problem of selecting the
optimal exit in an unsupervised setting. Prior works tackled this problem in an
offline supervised setting assuming that enough labeled data is available to
estimate the error rate at each exit point and tune the parameters for better
accuracy. However, pre-trained DNNs are often deployed in new domains for which
a large amount of ground truth may not be available. We model the problem of
exit selection as an unsupervised online learning problem and use bandit theory
to identify the optimal exit point. Specifically, we focus on Elastic BERT, a
pre-trained multi-exit DNN to demonstrate that it `nearly' satisfies the Strong
Dominance (SD) property making it possible to learn the optimal exit in an
online setup without knowing the ground truth labels. We develop upper
confidence bound (UCB) based algorithm named UEE-UCB that provably achieves
sub-linear regret under the SD property. Thus our method provides a means to
adaptively learn domain-specific optimal exit points in multi-exit DNNs. We
empirically validate our algorithm on IMDb and Yelp datasets.

Moreover, deep networks often fail to perform well when the blurry images and

to ordinary classification. Those approaches, however, face several
limitations, such as the tendency to overfit or be hooked on deep models. In
this paper, we sidestep those limitations with a novel perspective--reduction
to probability estimates of complementary classes. We prove that accurate
probability estimates of complementary labels lead to good classifiers through
a simple decoding step. The proof establishes a reduction framework from CLL to
probability estimates. The framework offers explanations of several key CLL
approaches as its special cases and allows us to design an improved algorithm
that is more robust in noisy environments. The framework also suggests a
validation procedure based on the quality of probability estimates, leading to
an alternative way to validate models with only complementary labels. The
flexible framework opens a wide range of unexplored opportunities in using deep

scenes with a single dominant object (e.g., images from ImageNet). On the other
hand, natural scenes include multiple dominant objects that are semantically
related. Thus, it is crucial to explore designing attack strategies that look
beyond learning on single-object scenes or attack single-object victim
classifiers. Due to their inherent property of strong transferability of
perturbations to unknown models, this paper presents the first approach of
using generative models for adversarial attacks on multi-object scenes. In
order to represent the relationships between different objects in the input
scene, we leverage upon the open-sourced pre-trained vision-language model CLIP
(Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), with the motivation to exploit the
encoded semantics in the language space along with the visual space. We call
this attack approach Generative Adversarial Multi-object scene Attacks (GAMA).
GAMA demonstrates the utility of the CLIP model as an attacker's tool to train
formidable perturbation generators for multi-object scenes. Using the joint
image-text features to train the generator, we show that GAMA can craft potent
transferable perturbations in order to fool victim classifiers in various
attack settings. For example, GAMA triggers ~16% more misclassification than
state-of-the-art generative approaches in black-box settings where both the
classifier architecture and data distribution of the attacker are different
from the victim. Our code will be made publicly available soon.

reconstructing watertight surfaces from 3D point samples thanks to its
efficiency, simplicity, and robustness. Yet, the existing PSR method and
subsequent variants work only for oriented points. This paper intends to
validate that an improved PSR, called iPSR, can completely eliminate the
requirement of point normals and proceed in an iterative manner. In each
iteration, iPSR takes as input point samples with normals directly computed
from the surface obtained in the preceding iteration, and then generates a new
surface with better quality. Extensive quantitative evaluation confirms that
the new iPSR algorithm converges in 5-30 iterations even with randomly
initialized normals. If initialized with a simple visibility based heuristic,
iPSR can further reduce the number of iterations. We conduct comprehensive
comparisons with PSR and other powerful implicit-function based methods.
Finally, we confirm iPSR's effectiveness and scalability on the AIM@SHAPE
dataset and challenging (indoor and outdoor) scenes. Code and data for this

From this, we explain how innovators differ from other employees in terms of

to 3D models not being able to exploit the spatial information because of the

a finite alphabet and is equipped with a local map defining the evolution of
the state of the node depending on its neighbors. They are studied both from
the dynamical and the computational complexity point of view. Inspired from
well-established notions in the context of cellular automata, we develop a
theory of intrinsic simulations and universality for families of automata
networks. We establish many consequences of intrinsic universality in terms of
complexity of orbits (periods of attractors, transients, etc) as well as
hardness of the standard well-studied decision problems for automata networks
(short/long term prediction, reachability, etc). In the way, we prove
orthogonality results for these problems: the hardness of a single one does not
imply hardness of the others, while intrinsic universality implies hardness of
all of them. As a complement, we develop a proof technique to establish
intrinsic simulation and universality results which is suitable to deal with
families of symmetric networks were connections are non-oriented. It is based
on an operation of glueing of networks, which allows to produce complex orbits
in large networks from compatible pseudo-orbits in small networks. As an
illustration, we give a short proof that the family of networks were each node
obeys the rule of the 'game of life' cellular automaton is strongly universal.
This formalism and proof technique is also applied in a companion paper devoted

simplicity and ability in handling both numerical data and categorical data.
However, lack of modeling of correlations between features limits its
performance. In addition, noise and outliers in the real-world dataset also
greatly degrade the classification performance. In this paper, we propose a
feature augmentation method employing a stack auto-encoder to reduce the noise
in the data and boost the discriminant power of naive Bayes. The proposed stack
auto-encoder consists of two auto-encoders for different purposes. The first
encoder shrinks the initial features to derive a compact feature representation
in order to remove the noise and redundant information. The second encoder
boosts the discriminant power of the features by expanding them into a
higher-dimensional space so that different classes of samples could be better
separated in the higher-dimensional space. By integrating the proposed feature
augmentation method with the regularized naive Bayes, the discrimination power
of the model is greatly enhanced. The proposed method is evaluated on a set of
machine-learning benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the
proposed method significantly and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
naive Bayes classifiers.

interactions of intra-class patches and unoriented interactions of inter-class

for image parsing to enable image patches to interact following a relation
reasoning pattern. Specifically, the linearly embedded image patches are first
projected into the graph space, where each node represents the implicit visual
center for a cluster of image patches and each edge reflects the relation
weight between two adjacent nodes. After that, global relation reasoning is
performed on this graph accordingly. Finally, all nodes including the relation
information are mapped back into the original space for subsequent processes.
Compared to the conventional transformer, GReaT has higher interaction
efficiency and a more purposeful interaction pattern. Experiments are carried
out on the challenging Cityscapes and ADE20K datasets. Results show that GReaT

subsequent bug reports. Hence, it is important to refer some bugs to the
designer to check the possible design flaws. Based on our best knowledge, there
are a few works that have considered referring bugs to designers. Hence, this
issue is considered in this work. In this paper, a dataset is created, and a
CNN-based model is proposed to predict the need for assigning a bug to a

the PyTorch pre-trained models (VGG19\_bn and WideResNet -101) are applied in
the MNIST dataset for the first time as initialization and with modified fully
connected layers. The employed PyTorch pre-trained models were previously
trained in ImageNet. The proposed model is developed and verified in the Kaggle
notebook, and it reached the outstanding accuracy of 99.77% without taking a
huge computational time during the training process of the network. We also
applied the same methodology to the SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19 Detection
dataset and achieved 80.01% accuracy. In contrast, the previous methods need a
huge compactional time during the training process to reach a high-performing

CAN protocol from a security standpoint. Application-layer attacks, which
involve the creation of malicious packets, are deemed feasible from remote but
can be easily detected by modern IDS. On the other hand, more recent link-layer
attacks are stealthier and possibly more disruptive but require physical access
to the bus. In this paper, we present CANflict, a software-only approach that
allows reliable manipulation of the CAN bus at the data link layer from an
unmodified microcontroller, overcoming the limitations of state-of-the-art
works. We demonstrate that it is possible to deploy stealthy CAN link-layer
attacks from a remotely compromised ECU, targeting another ECU on the same CAN
network. To do this, we exploit the presence of pin conflicts between
microcontroller peripherals to craft polyglot frames, which allows an attacker
to control the CAN traffic at the bit level and bypass the protocol's rules. We
experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on high-, mid-,
and low-end microcontrollers, and we provide the ground for future research by
releasing an extensible tool that can be used to implement our approach on
different platforms and to build CAN countermeasures at the data link layer.

transmission to reduce the age of information in wireless networks. In
particular, two CR-NOMA transmission protocols are developed by utilizing the
key features of different data generation models and applying CR-NOMA as an
add-on to a legacy orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based network. The fact
that the implementation of CR-NOMA causes little disruption to the legacy OMA
network means that the proposed CR-NOMA protocols can be practically
implemented in various communication systems which are based on OMA.
Closed-form expressions for the AoI achieved by the proposed NOMA protocols are
developed to facilitate performance evaluation, and asymptotic studies are
carried out to identify two benefits of using NOMA to reduce the AoI in
wireless networks. One is that the use of NOMA provides users more
opportunities to transmit, which means that the users can update their base
station more frequently. The other is that the use of NOMA can reduce access
delay, i.e., the users are scheduled to transmit earlier than in the OMA case,
which is useful to improve the freshness of the data available in the wireless
network.

many applications. Typically, machine learning models in classification or

the uncertainty of the models can play a critical role for example in active
learning or machine human interaction. Uncertainty quantification is especially
difficult when using deep learning-based models, which are the state-of-the-art
in many imaging applications. The current uncertainty quantification approaches
do not scale well in high-dimensional real-world problems. Scalable solutions
often rely on classical techniques, such as dropout, during inference or
training ensembles of identical models with different random seeds to obtain a
posterior distribution. In this paper, we show that these approaches fail to
approximate the classification probability. On the contrary, we propose a
scalable and intuitive framework to calibrate ensembles of deep learning models
to produce uncertainty quantification measurements that approximate the
classification probability. On unseen test data, we demonstrate improved
calibration, sensitivity (in two out of three cases) and precision when being

  Algorithm Co-design",Paper accepted by MICRO'22,,,,cs.AR cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Attention-based neural networks have become pervasive in many AI tasks.
Despite their excellent algorithmic performance, the use of the attention
mechanism and feed-forward network (FFN) demands excessive computational and
memory resources, which often compromises their hardware performance. Although
various sparse variants have been introduced, most approaches only focus on
mitigating the quadratic scaling of attention on the algorithm level, without
explicitly considering the efficiency of mapping their methods on real hardware
designs. Furthermore, most efforts only focus on either the attention mechanism
or the FFNs but without jointly optimizing both parts, causing most of the
current designs to lack scalability when dealing with different input lengths.
This paper systematically considers the sparsity patterns in different variants
from a hardware perspective. On the algorithmic level, we propose FABNet, a
hardware-friendly variant that adopts a unified butterfly sparsity pattern to
approximate both the attention mechanism and the FFNs. On the hardware level, a
novel adaptable butterfly accelerator is proposed that can be configured at
runtime via dedicated hardware control to accelerate different butterfly layers
using a single unified hardware engine. On the Long-Range-Arena dataset, FABNet
achieves the same accuracy as the vanilla Transformer while reducing the amount
of computation by 10 to 66 times and the number of parameters 2 to 22 times. By
jointly optimizing the algorithm and hardware, our FPGA-based butterfly
accelerator achieves 14.2 to 23.2 times speedup over state-of-the-art
accelerators normalized to the same computational budget. Compared with
optimized CPU and GPU designs on Raspberry Pi 4 and Jetson Nano, our system is
up to 273.8 and 15.1 times faster under the same power budget.

learning (RL), the realistic RL regime where the decisions made by SNN and
their evaluation in terms of reward/punishment signals may be separated by
significant time interval and sequence of intermediate evaluation-neutral world
states. In the present work, I formalize world dynamics as a Markov chain with
unknown a priori state transition probabilities, which should be learnt by the
network. To make this problem formulation more realistic, I solve it in
continuous time, so that duration of every state in the Markov chain may be
different and is unknown. It is demonstrated how this task can be accomplished
by an SNN with specially designed structure and local synaptic plasticity
rules. As an example, we show how this network motif works in the simple but
non-trivial world where a ball moves inside a square box and bounces from its
walls with a random new direction and velocity.

Some prior works solved the issues by separating features of positive samples

considerably depend on the characteristics and statistics of the samples used
for training. Thus, we propose a novel framework named sampling independent
robust feature representation network~(SirNet) that learns disentangled feature
embedding from randomly chosen samples. A carefully designed sampling
independent maximum discrepancy loss is introduced to model samples of the same

Researchers have intensively studied this threat for several years and proposed
dozens of approaches to create adversarial examples (AEs). But most of the
approaches are only evaluated on limited models and datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR-10). Thus, the effectiveness of attacking real-world DL models is not
quite clear. In this paper, we perform the first systematic study of
adversarial attacks on real-world DNN models and provide a real-world model
dataset named RWM. Particularly, we design a suite of approaches to adapt
current AE generation algorithms to the diverse real-world DL models, including
automatically extracting DL models from Android apps, capturing the inputs and
outputs of the DL models in apps, generating AEs and validating them by
observing the apps' execution. For black-box DL models, we design a
semantic-based approach to build suitable datasets and use them for training
substitute models when performing transfer-based attacks. After analyzing 245
DL models collected from 62,583 real-world apps, we have a unique opportunity
to understand the gap between real-world DL models and contemporary AE
generation algorithms. To our surprise, the current AE generation algorithms
can only directly attack 6.53% of the models. Benefiting from our approach, the
success rate upgrades to 47.35%.

provider documentation, passive DNS data, and active scanning. For analyzing
IoT traffic patterns, we rely on passive network flows from a major European

  Our analysis focuses on the top IoT backends and unveils diverse operational
strategies -- from operating their own infrastructure to utilizing the public

in multiple locations and countries. Still, a handful are located only in one
country, which could raise regulatory scrutiny as the client IoT devices are
located in other regions. Indeed, our analysis shows that up to 35% of IoT
traffic is exchanged with IoT backend servers located in other continents. We
also find that at least six of the top IoT backends rely on other IoT backend
providers. We also evaluate if cascading effects among the IoT backend

emerging maritime Internet of Things use cases, such as smart ports, autonomous
navigation, and ocean monitoring systems. The major enabler for this exciting
ecosystem is the provision of broadband, low-delay, and reliable wireless
coverage to the ever-increasing number of vessels, buoys, platforms, sensors,
and actuators. Towards this end, the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) in maritime communications introduces an aerial dimension to wireless
connectivity going above and beyond current deployments, which are mainly
relying on shore-based base stations with limited coverage and satellite links
with high latency. Considering the potential of UAV-aided wireless
communications, this survey presents the state-of-the-art in UAV-aided maritime
communications, which, in general, are based on both conventional optimization
and machine-learning-aided approaches. More specifically, relevant UAV-based
network architectures are discussed together with the role of their building
blocks. Then, physical-layer, resource management, and cloud/edge computing and
caching UAV-aided solutions in maritime environments are discussed and grouped
based on their performance targets. Moreover, as UAVs are characterized by
flexible deployment with high re-positioning capabilities, studies on UAV
trajectory optimization for maritime applications are thoroughly discussed. In
addition, aiming at shedding light on the current status of real-world
deployments, experimental studies on UAV-aided maritime communications are
presented and implementation details are given. Finally, several important open
issues in the area of UAV-aided maritime communications are given, related to
the integration of sixth generation (6G) advancements.

intelligent video analysis, surveillance video retrieval, and other application
scenarios. Nowadays, the deep-learning-based MTMCT has been the mainstream and
has achieved fascinating improvements regarding tracking accuracy and
efficiency. However, according to our investigation, the lacking of datasets
focusing on real-world application scenarios limits the further improvements
for current learning-based MTMCT models. Specifically, the learning-based MTMCT
models training by common datasets usually cannot achieve satisfactory results
in real-world application scenarios. Motivated by this, this paper presents a
semi-automatic data annotation system to facilitate the real-world MTMCT
dataset establishment. The proposed system first employs a deep-learning-based
single-camera trajectory generation method to automatically extract
trajectories from surveillance videos. Subsequently, the system provides a
recommendation list in the following manual cross-camera trajectory matching
process. The recommendation list is generated based on side information,
including camera location, timestamp relation, and background scene. In the
experimental stage, extensive results further demonstrate the efficiency of the
proposed system.

various combinatorial search domains, such as two-player games and scientific
discovery. However, directly applying deep RL in planning domains is still
challenging. One major difficulty is that without a human-crafted heuristic
function, reward signals remain zero unless the learning framework discovers
any solution plan. Search space becomes \emph{exponentially larger} as the
minimum length of plans grows, which is a serious limitation for planning
instances with a minimum plan length of hundreds to thousands of steps.
Previous learning frameworks that augment graph search with deep neural
networks and extra generated subgoals have achieved success in various
challenging planning domains. However, generating useful subgoals requires
extensive domain knowledge. We propose a domain-independent method that
augments graph search with graph value iteration to solve hard planning
instances that are out of reach for domain-specialized solvers. In particular,
instead of receiving learning signals only from discovered plans, our approach
also learns from failed search attempts where no goal state has been reached.
The graph value iteration component can exploit the graph structure of local
search space and provide more informative learning signals. We also show how we
use a curriculum strategy to smooth the learning process and perform a full
analysis of how graph value iteration scales and enables learning.

  settings: A fetal ultrasound study in 5 African countries",,,,,eess.IV cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Most artificial intelligence (AI) research have concentrated in high-income
countries, where imaging data, IT infrastructures and clinical expertise are
plentiful. However, slower progress has been made in limited-resource
environments where medical imaging is needed. For example, in Sub-Saharan
Africa the rate of perinatal mortality is very high due to limited access to
antenatal screening. In these countries, AI models could be implemented to help
clinicians acquire fetal ultrasound planes for diagnosis of fetal
abnormalities. So far, deep learning models have been proposed to identify
standard fetal planes, but there is no evidence of their ability to generalise
in centres with limited access to high-end ultrasound equipment and data. This
work investigates different strategies to reduce the domain-shift effect for a
fetal plane classification model trained on a high-resource clinical centre and
transferred to a new low-resource centre. To that end, a classifier trained
with 1,792 patients from Spain is first evaluated on a new centre in Denmark in
optimal conditions with 1,008 patients and is later optimised to reach the same
performance in five African centres (Egypt, Algeria, Uganda, Ghana and Malawi)
with 25 patients each. The results show that a transfer learning approach can
be a solution to integrate small-size African samples with existing large-scale
databases in developed countries. In particular, the model can be re-aligned
and optimised to boost the performance on African populations by increasing the
recall to $0.92 \pm 0.04$ and at the same time maintaining a high precision
across centres. This framework shows promise for building new AI models
generalisable across clinical centres with limited data acquired in challenging
and heterogeneous conditions and calls for further research to develop new
solutions for usability of AI in countries with less resources.

multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems optimally. The core idea of CBS is to
run hierarchical search, when, on the high level the tree of solutions
candidates is explored, and on the low-level an individual planning for a
specific agent (subject to certain constraints) is carried out. To trade-off
optimality for running time different variants of bounded sub-optimal CBS were
designed, which alter both high- and low-level search routines of CBS.
Moreover, anytime variant of CBS does exist that applies Focal Search (FS) to
the high-level of CBS - Anytime BCBS. However, no comprehensive analysis of how
well this algorithm performs compared to the naive one, when we simply
re-invoke CBS with the decreased sub-optimality bound, was present. This work
aims at filling this gap. Moreover, we present and evaluate another anytime
version of CBS that uses FS on both levels of CBS. Empirically, we show that
its behavior is principally different from the one demonstrated by Anytime
BCBS. Finally, we compare both algorithms head-to-head and show that using

new unseen task can be learned within a few gradient updates. Model Agnostic
Meta-Learning (MAML) is a benchmark algorithm comprising two optimization
loops. The inner loop is dedicated to learning a new task and the outer loop
leads to meta-initialization. However, ANIL (almost no inner loop) algorithm
shows that feature reuse is an alternative to rapid learning in MAML. Thus, the
meta-initialization phase makes MAML primed for feature reuse and obviates the
need for rapid learning. Contrary to ANIL, we hypothesize that there may be a
need to learn new features during meta-testing. A new unseen task from
non-similar distribution would necessitate rapid learning in addition reuse and
recombination of existing features. In this paper, we invoke the width-depth
duality of neural networks, wherein, we increase the width of the network by
adding extra computational units (ACU). The ACUs enable the learning of new
atomic features in the meta-testing task, and the associated increased width
facilitates information propagation in the forwarding pass. The newly learnt
features combine with existing features in the last layer for meta-learning.

classes from source domain to target domain without any prior knowledge on the
label set, which requires to distinguish the unknown samples from the known
ones in the target domain. Like the traditional unsupervised domain adaptation
problem, the misalignment between two domains exists due to the biased and
less-discriminative embedding. Recent methods proposed to complete the domain
misalignment by clustering target samples with the nearest neighbors or the
prototypes. However, it is dangerous to do so since we do not have any prior
knowledge about the distributions of unknown samples which can magnify the
misalignment especially when the unknown set is big. Meanwhile, other existing
classifier-based methods could easily produce overconfident predictions of
unknown samples because of the supervised objective in source domain leading
the whole model to be biased towards the common classes in the target domain.
Therefore, we propose a novel non-parameter unknown samples detection method
based on mapping the samples in the original feature space into a reliable
linear sub-space which makes data points more sparse to reduce the misalignment
between unknown samples and source samples. Moreover, unlike the recent methods
applying extra parameters to improve the classification of unknown samples,
this paper well balances the confidence values of both known and unknown
samples through an unknown-adaptive margin loss which can control the gradient
updating of the classifier learning on supervised source samples depending on
the confidence level of detected unknown samples at current step. Finally,
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

scenarios a several thousand times faster than the original model, making them
ideal for policy exploration. We demonstrate that replacing a traditional

automation challenging. Large amounts of data recorded by sensors need to be
processed to adequately perform tasks such as diagnosis in case of fault. A
promising approach to deal with this complexity is the concept of causality.
However, most research on causality has focused on inferring causal relations
between parts of an unknown system. Engineering uses causality in a
fundamentally different way: complex systems are constructed by combining
components with known, controllable behavior. As CPS are constructed by the
second approach, most data-based causality models are not suited for industrial
automation. To bridge this gap, a Uniform Causality Model for various
application areas of industrial automation is proposed, which will allow better
communication and better data usage across disciplines. The resulting model
describes the behavior of CPS mathematically and, as the model is evaluated on
the unique requirements of the application areas, it is shown that the Uniform
Causality Model can work as a basis for the application of new approaches in
industrial automation that focus on machine learning.

this study introduces a new ensemble model for predicting sediment transport
rates. Model inputs include wave height, wave velocity, density cover, wave

(SCA), and GMDH particle swarm optimization (GMDH-PSO), were used to predict

ensemble model was 0.145 m3/s, while the MAEs of GMDH-HBA, GMDH-RSOA, GMDH-SCA,
GMDH-PSOA, and GMDH in the testing level were 0.176 m3/s, 0.312 m3/s, 0.367

90 percent. The results indicated that the ensemble and GMDH-HBA models could

  Reinforcement Learning",Accept at NeurIPS 2022,,,,cs.MA,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, centralized training and
decentralized execution (CTDE) has achieved remarkable success. Individual
Global Max (IGM) decomposition, which is an important element of CTDE, measures
the consistency between local and joint policies. The majority of IGM-based
research focuses on how to establish this consistent relationship, but little
attention has been paid to examining IGM's potential flaws. In this work, we
reveal that the IGM condition is a lossy decomposition, and the error of lossy
decomposition will accumulated in hypernetwork-based methods. To address the
above issue, we propose to adopt an imitation learning strategy to separate the
lossy decomposition from Bellman iterations, thereby avoiding error
accumulation. The proposed strategy is theoretically proved and empirically
verified on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge benchmark problem with zero
sight view. The results also confirm that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art IGM-based approaches.

evolved at a tremendous speed. Security and privacy are key concerns on the
IoMT, owing to the huge scale and deployment of IoMT networks. Machine learning
(ML) and blockchain (BC) technologies have significantly enhanced the
capabilities and facilities of healthcare 5.0, spawning a new area known as
""Smart Healthcare."" By identifying concerns early, a smart healthcare system
can help avoid long-term damage. This will enhance the quality of life for
patients while reducing their stress and healthcare costs. The IoMT enables a
range of functionalities in the field of information technology, one of which
is smart and interactive health care. However, combining medical data into a
single storage location to train a powerful machine learning model raises
concerns about privacy, ownership, and compliance with greater concentration.
Federated learning (FL) overcomes the preceding difficulties by utilizing a
centralized aggregate server to disseminate a global learning model.
Simultaneously, the local participant keeps control of patient information,
assuring data confidentiality and security. This article conducts a
comprehensive analysis of the findings on blockchain technology entangled with
federated learning in healthcare. 5.0. The purpose of this study is to
construct a secure health monitoring system in healthcare 5.0 by utilizing a
blockchain technology and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect any
malicious activity in a healthcare network and enables physicians to monitor
patients through medical sensors and take necessary measures periodically by
predicting diseases.

the fast development of computer technology, more and more study on

main problems in these approaches: 1) hard to handle the complex functions of
stationary and non-stationary, periodic and non-periodic, high order and low
order; 2) hard to generalize the fitting functions from training data to test
data. In this paper, a multiple regression based function fitting network that
solves the two main problems is introduced as a predicable function fitting
technique. This technique constructs the network includes three main parts: 1)
the stationary transform layer, 2) the feature encoding layers, and 3) the fine

input function data, and transforms non-stationary function to stationary
function. The feature encoding layers encode the raw input sequential data to a
novel linear regression feature that can capture both the structural and the
temporal characters of the sequential data. The fine tuning regression layer
then fits the features to the target ahead values. The fitting network with the
linear regression feature layers and a non-linear regression layer come up with
high quality fitting results and generalizable predictions. The experiments of

the efficiency of the proposed technique.

These models take as input a sequence of high-fidelity vector solutions for
consecutive time-steps obtained from the PDEs and forecast the solutions for
the subsequent time-steps using auto-regression; thereby reducing the
computation time and power needed to obtain such high-fidelity solutions. The
models are tested on numerical benchmarks (1D Burgers' equation and Stoker's

technology with the potential of far-reaching impact in domains ranging from

emerging BCI applications are typically still at early technology readiness
levels, but because BCIs create novel, technical communication channels for the
human brain, they have raised privacy and security concerns. To mitigate such
risks, a large body of countermeasures has been proposed in the literature, but
a general framework is lacking which would describe how privacy and security of
BCI applications can be protected by design, i.e., already as an integral part
of the early BCI design process, in a systematic manner, and allowing suitable
depth of analysis for different contexts such as commercial BCI product
development vs. academic research and lab prototypes. Here we propose the
adoption of recent systems-engineering methodologies for privacy threat
modeling, risk assessment, and privacy engineering to the BCI field. These
methodologies address privacy and security concerns in a more systematic and
holistic way than previous approaches, and provide reusable patterns on how to
move from principles to actions. We apply these methodologies to BCI and data
flows and derive a generic, extensible, and actionable framework for
brain-privacy-preserving cybersecurity in BCI applications. This framework is
designed for flexible application to the wide range of current and future BCI

expensive black-box functions such as tuning hyperparameter, and designing new
material, etc. Despite its popularity, less attention has been paid to
analyzing the inherent hardness of the problem although, given its extensive
use, it is important to understand the fundamental limits of efficient global
optimization algorithms. In this paper, we study the worst-case complexity of
the efficient global optimization problem and, in contrast to existing
kernel-specific results, we derive a unified lower bound for the complexity of
efficient global optimization in terms of the metric entropy of a ball in its
corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space~(RKHS). Specifically, we show
that if there exists a deterministic algorithm that achieves suboptimality gap
smaller than $\epsilon$ for any function $f\in S$ in $T$ function evaluations,
it is necessary that $T$ is at least
$\Omega\left(\frac{\log\mathcal{N}(S(\mathcal{X}),
4\epsilon,\|\cdot\|_\infty)}{\log(\frac{R}{\epsilon})}\right)$, where
$\mathcal{N}(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)$ is the covering number, $S$ is the ball
centered at $0$ with radius $R$ in the RKHS and $S(\mathcal{X})$ is the
restriction of $S$ over the feasible set $\mathcal{X}$. Moreover, we show that
this lower bound nearly matches the upper bound attained by non-adaptive search
algorithms for the commonly used squared exponential kernel and the Mat\'ern
kernel with a large smoothness parameter $\nu$, up to a replacement of $d/2$ by
$d$ and a logarithmic term $\log\frac{R}{\epsilon}$. That is to say, our lower
bound is nearly optimal for these kernels.

computer vision. Traditionally pose estimation is concerned with the
determination of a single best estimate. However, a single estimate is unable

symmetries or occlusion of identifying features. Inability to account for
ambiguities in pose can lead to failure in subsequent methods, which is
unacceptable when the cost of failure is high. Estimates of full pose
distributions are, contrary to single estimates, well suited for expressing
uncertainty on pose. Motivated by this, we propose a novel pose distribution
estimation method. An implicit formulation of the probability distribution over
object pose is derived from an intermediary representation of an object as a
set of keypoints. This ensures that the pose distribution estimates have a high
level of interpretability. Furthermore, our method is based on conservative
approximations, which leads to reliable estimates. The method has been

the throughput performance of WLAN. However, it is difficult to efficiently
utilize the benefits of frame aggregation in the downlink MU-MIMO channels as
stations have heterogeneous transmission demands and data transmission rates.
As a result of this, wasted space channel time will occur which degrades
transmission efficiency. In addressing these challenges, the existing studies
have proposed different approaches. However, most of these approaches did not
consider a machine-Learning based optimization solution. The main contribution
of this paper is to propose a machine-learning-based frame size optimization
solution to maximize the system throughput of WLAN in the downlink MU-MIMO
channel. In this approach, the Access Point (AP) performs the maximum system
throughput measurement and collected frame size-system throughput patterns
which contain knowledge about the effects of traffic patterns, channel

uses a neural network to correctly model the system throughput as a function of

predictive modeling tasks for graph-structured data.
  Amongst those tasks, link prediction is one of the fundamental problems for
many real-world applications, such as recommender systems.
  However, GNNs are not immune to adversarial attacks, i.e., carefully crafted
malicious examples that are designed to fool the predictive model.
  In this work, we focus on a specific, white-box attack to GNN-based link
prediction models, where a malicious node aims to appear in the list of
recommended nodes for a given target victim.
  To achieve this goal, the attacker node may also count on the cooperation of
other existing peers that it directly controls, namely on the ability to inject
a number of ``vicious'' nodes in the network.
  Specifically, all these malicious nodes can add new edges or remove existing
ones, thereby perturbing the original graph.
  Thus, we propose SAVAGE, a novel framework and a method to mount this type of
link prediction attacks.
  SAVAGE formulates the adversary's goal as an optimization task, striking the
balance between the effectiveness of the attack and the sparsity of malicious
resources required.
  Extensive experiments conducted on real-world and synthetic datasets
demonstrate that adversarial attacks implemented through SAVAGE indeed achieve
high attack success rate yet using a small amount of vicious nodes.
  Finally, despite those attacks require full knowledge of the target model, we
show that they are successfully transferable to other black-box methods for
link prediction.

motion. This simple (yet effective) two-fold actuation allows the system to

proving safety of hybrid systems possibly over an infinite time horizon. We
present a novel condition on barrier certificates, termed the invariant
barrier-certificate condition, that witnesses unbounded-time safety of

one to attain inductive invariance. We show that discharging the invariant
barrier-certificate condition -- thereby synthesizing invariant barrier
certificates -- can be encoded as solving an optimization problem subject to
bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). We further propose a synthesis algorithm

to solve small-scale network reliability problems. The BAT was recently
proposed as a simple, fast, easy-to-code, and flexible make-to-fit
exact-solution algorithm. Based on the experimental results, the BAT and its
variants outperformed other implicit enumeration algorithms. Hence, to overcome
the above-mentioned obstacle as a result of the size problem, a new parallel
BAT (PBAT) was proposed to improve the BAT based on compute multithread
architecture to calculate the binary-state network reliability problem, which
is fundamental for all types of network reliability problems. From the analysis
of the time complexity and experiments conducted on 20 benchmarks of
binary-state network reliability problems, PBAT was able to efficiently solve
medium-scale network reliability problems.

organizations to identify and alleviate potential deviations from the intended
process behavior. To fully leverage its benefits, it is important that
conformance checking results are visualized in a way that is approachable and
understandable for non-expert users. However, the visualization of conformance
checking results has so far not been widely considered in research. Therefore,
the goal of this paper is to develop an understanding of how conformance
checking results are visualized by process mining tools to provide a foundation
for further research on this topic. We conduct a systematic study, where we
analyze the visualization capabilities of nine academic and seven commercial
tools by means of a visual analytics framework. In this study, we find that the
''Why?'' aspect of conformance checking visualization seems already be
well-defined, but the ''What?'' and ''How?'' aspects require future research.

Protection Regulation (GDPR) through data processing agreements (DPAs).
Checking the compliance of DPAs contributes to the compliance verification of
software systems as DPAs are an important source of requirements for software
development involving the processing of personal data. However, manually
checking whether a given DPA complies with GDPR is challenging as it requires
significant time and effort for understanding and identifying DPA-relevant
compliance requirements in GDPR and then verifying these requirements in the
DPA. In this paper, we propose an automated solution to check the compliance of
a given DPA against GDPR. In close interaction with legal experts, we first
built two artifacts: (i) the ""shall"" requirements extracted from the GDPR
provisions relevant to DPA compliance and (ii) a glossary table defining the
legal concepts in the requirements. Then, we developed an automated solution
that leverages natural language processing (NLP) technologies to check the
compliance of a given DPA against these ""shall"" requirements. Specifically, our
approach automatically generates phrasal-level representations for the textual
content of the DPA and compares it against predefined representations of the
""shall"" requirements. Over a dataset of 30 actual DPAs, the approach correctly
finds 618 out of 750 genuine violations while raising 76 false violations, and
further correctly identifies 524 satisfied requirements. The approach has thus
an average precision of 89.1%, a recall of 82.4%, and an accuracy of 84.6%.
Compared to a baseline that relies on off-the-shelf NLP tools, our approach
provides an average accuracy gain of ~20 percentage points. The accuracy of our

driving but is extremely challenging due to staggering motion uncertainty.
Recently, most motion forecasting methods resort to the goal-based strategy,
i.e., predicting endpoints of motion trajectories as conditions to regress the
entire trajectories, so that the search space of solution can be reduced.
However, accurate goal coordinates are hard to predict and evaluate. In
addition, the point representation of the destination limits the utilization of
a rich road context, leading to inaccurate prediction results in many cases.
Goal area, i.e., the possible destination area, rather than goal coordinate,
could provide a more soft constraint for searching potential trajectories by
involving more tolerance and guidance. In view of this, we propose a new goal
area-based framework, named Goal Area Network (GANet), for motion forecasting,
which models goal areas rather than exact goal coordinates as preconditions for
trajectory prediction, performing more robustly and accurately. Specifically,
we propose a GoICrop (Goal Area of Interest) operator to effectively extract
semantic lane features in goal areas and model actors' future interactions,
which benefits a lot for future trajectory estimations. GANet ranks the 1st on
the leaderboard of Argoverse Challenge among all public literature (till the

numerous good properties for this use case: it has a concise specification,
well-behaved model theory, and it supports a wide range of language features

prove its correctness. Our algorithm is ""staging-by-evaluation"", analogously to
the technique of normalization-by-evaluation, in that staging is given by the
evaluation of 2LTT syntax in a semantic domain. The staging algorithm together
with its correctness constitutes a proof of strong conservativity of 2LLT over

we show that the rich information represented as LPG labels and properties is

diffusion coefficients can both grow polynomially. The upper mean-square error
bounds of BEM are obtained. Then the convergence rate, which is one-half, is
revealed without using the moment boundedness of numerical solutions.
Furthermore, under fairly general conditions, the novel technique is applied to
prove that the BEM can inherit the exponential mean-square stability with a
simple proof. At last, two numerical experiments are implemented to illustrate
the reliability of the theories.

Europe, which implicitly encodes local knowledge, cultural traditions, artistic
expression, and history of its speakers. However, over 30 language varieties in
Italy are at risk of disappearing within few generations. Language technology
has a main role in preserving endangered languages, but it currently struggles
with such varieties as they are under-resourced and mostly lack standardized
orthography, being mainly used in spoken settings. In this paper, we introduce
the linguistic context of Italy and discuss challenges facing the development
of NLP technologies for Italy's language varieties. We provide potential
directions and advocate for a shift in the paradigm from machine-centric to
speaker-centric NLP. Finally, we propose building a local community towards
responsible, participatory development of speech and language technologies for

Torr",Dynamic Graph Message Passing Networks for Visual Recognition,PAMI extension of CVPR 2020 oral work arXiv:1908.06955,,,,cs.CV cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Modelling long-range dependencies is critical for scene understanding tasks
in computer vision. Although convolution neural networks (CNNs) have excelled
in many vision tasks, they are still limited in capturing long-range structured
relationships as they typically consist of layers of local kernels. A
fully-connected graph, such as the self-attention operation in Transformers, is
beneficial for such modelling, however, its computational overhead is
prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a dynamic graph message passing network,
that significantly reduces the computational complexity compared to related
works modelling a fully-connected graph. This is achieved by adaptively
sampling nodes in the graph, conditioned on the input, for message passing.
Based on the sampled nodes, we dynamically predict node-dependent filter
weights and the affinity matrix for propagating information between them. This
formulation allows us to design a self-attention module, and more importantly a
new Transformer-based backbone network, that we use for both image
classification pretraining, and for addressing various downstream tasks (object
detection, instance and semantic segmentation). Using this model, we show
significant improvements with respect to strong, state-of-the-art baselines on
four different tasks. Our approach also outperforms fully-connected graphs
while using substantially fewer floating-point operations and parameters. Code

models, which can extract the task-specific features supervised by the target

the feature interactions between the textual and either acoustic and visual
modalities, ignoring capturing the feature interactions between the acoustic

transformer (ME2ET), which can effectively model the tri-modal features
interaction among the textual, acoustic, and visual modalities at the low-level

attention, which can model the tri-modal feature interactions by adopting a
two-pass strategy and can further leverage such interactions to significantly
reduce the computation and memory complexity through reducing the input token
length. At the high-level, we introduce the tri-modal feature fusion layer to
explicitly aggregate the semantic representations of three modalities. The
experimental results on the CMU-MOSEI and IEMOCAP datasets show that ME2ET
achieves the state-of-the-art performance. The further in-depth analysis
demonstrates the effectiveness, efficiency, and interpretability of the
proposed progressive tri-modal attention, which can help our model to achieve
better performance while significantly reducing the computation and memory

Usually, several signature-based and statistical anomaly detectors are

peer-group behaviour. Statistically, the challenge consists of accurately
grouping users with similar behaviour, and then identifying those who deviate
from their peers. This work proposes a new approach for peer-group behaviour
modelling of Windows authentication events, using principles from hierarchical
Bayesian models. This is a two-stage approach where in the first stage,
peer-groups are formed based on a data-driven method, given the user's
individual authentication pattern. In the second stage, the counts of users
authenticating to different entities are aggregated by an hour and modelled by
a Poisson distribution, taking into account seasonality components and
hierarchical principles. Finally, we compare grouping users based on their

of electric vehicles (EVs) when participate in demand response (DR). As there
exist uncertainties in EVs' remaining energy, arrival and departure time, and
future electricity prices, it is quite difficult to make charging decisions to
minimize charging cost while guarantee that the EV's battery
state-of-the-charge (SOC) is within certain range. To handle with this dilemma,
this paper formulates the EV charging scheduling problem as a constrained
Markov decision process (CMDP). By synergistically combining the augmented
Lagrangian method and soft actor critic algorithm, a novel safe off-policy
reinforcement learning (RL) approach is proposed in this paper to solve the
CMDP. The actor network is updated in a policy gradient manner with the
Lagrangian value function. A double-critics network is adopted to synchronously
estimate the action-value function to avoid overestimation bias. The proposed
algorithm does not require strong convexity guarantee of examined problems and
is sample efficient. Comprehensive numerical experiments with real-world
electricity price demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can achieve high
solution optimality and constraints compliance.

training of a Federated Learning (FL) model act as a key stimulus for clients'

quality participation in FL due to the absence of: (i) full information on the
client's data quality and properties; (ii) the value of client's data
contributions; and (iii) the trusted mechanism for monetary incentive offers.
This often leads to poor efficiency in training and communication. While
several works focus on strategic incentive designs and client selection to
overcome this problem, there is a major knowledge gap in terms of an overall
design tailored to the foreseen digital economy, including Web 3.0, while
simultaneously meeting the learning objectives. To address this gap, we propose
a contribution-based tokenized incentive scheme, namely \texttt{FedToken},
backed by blockchain technology that ensures fair allocation of tokens amongst
the clients that corresponds to the valuation of their data during model
training. Leveraging the engineered Shapley-based scheme, we first approximate
the contribution of local models during model aggregation, then strategically
schedule clients lowering the communication rounds for convergence and anchor
ways to allocate \emph{affordable} tokens under a constrained monetary budget.
Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.

massive tasks offloading. However, with more dynamic devices brought online and
the uncontrollable stochastic channel environment, it is even desirable to
deploy appealing technique, i.e., intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), in the
MEC system to flexibly tune the communication environment and improve the
system energy efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the joint offloading,
communication and computation resource allocation for IRS-assisted NOMA MEC
system. We firstly formulate a mixed integer energy efficiency maximization
problem with system queue stability constraint. We then propose the
Lyapunov-function-based Mixed Integer Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(LMIDDPG) algorithm which is based on the centralized reinforcement learning
(RL) framework. To be specific, we design the mixed integer action space
mapping which contains both continuous mapping and integer mapping. Moreover,
the award function is defined as the upper-bound of the Lyapunov
drift-plus-penalty function. To enable end devices (EDs) to choose actions
independently at the execution stage, we further propose the Heterogeneous
Multi-agent LMIDDPG (HMA-LMIDDPG) algorithm based on distributed RL framework
with homogeneous EDs and heterogeneous base station (BS) as heterogeneous

superior energy efficiency performance to the benchmark algorithms while
maintaining the queue stability. Specially, the distributed structure
HMA-LMIDDPG can acquire more energy efficiency gain than centralized structure

often remain \ca across mainstream and fringe platforms, antisocial behaviors
may spill over onto the mainstream platform. We study this possible spillover
by analyzing around $70,000$ users from three banned communities that migrated
to fringe platforms: r/The\_Donald, r/GenderCritical, and r/Incels. Using a
difference-in-differences design, we contrast \ca users with matched

accuracy in night-time by converting infrared images to day-time RGB images.
However, these models have been found to under-perform during night-time
conditions compared to day-time conditions. Therefore, this study attempts to
alleviate this shortcoming by proposing three different approaches based on
combination of GAN models at two different levels that tries to reduce the
feature distribution gap between day-time and night-time infrared images.
Quantitative analysis to compare the performance of the proposed models with
the state-of-the-art models have been done by testing the models using
state-of-the-art object detection models. Both the quantitative and qualitative
analyses have shown that the proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art
GAN models for vehicle detection in night-time conditions, showing the efficacy
of the proposed models.

performance in breast cancer detection. However, high-density breasts show
poorer detection performance since dense tissues can mask or even simulate
masses. Therefore, the sensitivity of mammography for breast cancer detection
can be reduced by more than 20% in dense breasts. Additionally, extremely dense
cases reported an increased risk of cancer compared to low-density breasts.
This study aims to improve the mass detection performance in high-density
breasts using synthetic high-density full-field digital mammograms (FFDM) as
data augmentation during breast mass detection model training. To this end, a
total of five cycle-consistent GAN (CycleGAN) models using three FFDM datasets
were trained for low-to-high-density image translation in high-resolution
mammograms. The training images were split by breast density BI-RADS
categories, being BI-RADS A almost entirely fatty and BI-RADS D extremely dense
breasts. Our results showed that the proposed data augmentation technique
improved the sensitivity and precision of mass detection in high-density
breasts by 2% and 6% in two different test sets and was useful as a domain
adaptation technique. In addition, the clinical realism of the synthetic images
was evaluated in a reader study involving two expert radiologists and one
surgical oncologist.

approximation operator based on an equispaced grid of points. Like other

order to defeat the Runge phenomenon that occurs when using polynomial
interpolation on large sets of equally spaced points. The idea is to improve
the mock-Chebyshev subset interpolation, where the considered function $f$ is
interpolated only on a proper subset of the uniform grid, formed by nodes that
mimic the behavior of Chebyshev--Lobatto nodes. In the mock-Chebyshev subset
interpolation all remaining nodes are discarded, while in the constrained

  Graph-Based Modeling and Optimization Approach","30 pages, 10 figures",,,,cs.IT eess.SP math.IT,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can be densely deployed in complex
environment to create cascaded line-of-sight (LoS) paths between multiple base
stations (BSs) and users via tunable IRS reflections, thereby significantly
enhancing the coverage performance of wireless networks. To achieve this goal,
it is vital to optimize the deployed locations of BSs and IRSs in the wireless
network, which is investigated in this paper. Specifically, we divide the
coverage area of the network into multiple non-overlapping cells and decide
whether to deploy a BS/IRS in each cell given a total number of BSs/IRSs
available. We show that to ensure the network coverage/communication
performance, i.e., each cell has a direct/cascaded LoS path with at least one
BS, as well as such LoS paths have the average number of IRS reflections less
than a given threshold, there is a fundamental trade-off with the deployment
cost or the number of BSs/IRSs needed. To optimally characterize this
trade-off, we formulate a joint BS and IRS deployment problem based on graph
theory, which, however, is difficult to be optimally solved due to the
combinatorial optimization involved. To circumvent this difficulty, we first
consider a simplified problem with given BS deployment and propose the optimal
as well as an efficient suboptimal IRS deployment solution to it, by applying
the branch-and-bound method and iteratively removing IRSs from the candidate
locations, respectively. Next, an efficient sequential update algorithm is
proposed for solving the joint BS and IRS deployment problem. Numerical results
are provided to show the efficacy of the proposed design approach and
optimization algorithms for the joint BS and IRS deployment. The trade-off
between the network coverage performance and the number of deployed BSs/IRSs
with different cost ratios is also unveiled.

propositions; i.e., structured reasons justifying the belief in a proposition.
Using defeasible rules, arguments need not be valid in all circumstances,
therefore, it might be possible to construct an argument for a proposition as
well as its negation. When arguments support conflicting propositions, one of
the arguments must be defeated, which raises the question of \emph{which
(sub-)arguments can be subject to defeat}?
  In legal argumentation, meta-rules determine the valid arguments by
considering the last defeasible rule of each argument involved in a conflict.
Since it is easier to evaluate arguments using their last rules, \emph{can a
conflict be resolved by considering only the last defeasible rules of the
arguments involved}?
  We propose a new argument system where, instead of deriving a defeat relation
between arguments, \emph{undercutting-arguments} for the defeat of defeasible
rules are constructed. This system allows us, (\textit{i}) to resolve conflicts

field, in which the capabilities of the segmentation model are incrementally
improved by learning new classes or new domains. A central challenge in
Continual Learning is overcoming the effects of catastrophic forgetting, which
refers to the sudden drop in accuracy on previously learned tasks after the
model is trained on new classes or domains. In continual classification this
challenge is often overcome by replaying a small selection of samples from
previous tasks, however replay is rarely considered in CSS. Therefore, we
investigate the influences of various replay strategies for semantic
segmentation and evaluate them in class- and domain-incremental settings. Our
findings suggest that in a class-incremental setting, it is critical to achieve
a uniform distribution for the different classes in the buffer to avoid a bias
towards newly learned classes. In the domain-incremental setting, it is most
effective to select buffer samples by uniformly sampling from the distribution
of learned feature representations or by choosing samples with median entropy.
Finally, we observe that the effective sampling methods help to decrease the

frequencies can be characteristic of the underlying noise distribution caused
by the image acquisition rather than in relation to the task-relevant

Dropout, to prevent convolutional neural networks from learning

maps during training which acts as a feature-level regularization. In this

which focuses on hard-to-distinguish object classes. To improve the
fine-grained classification accuracy, penalizing confident model predictions by
maximizing entropy was found useful in the literature. Inline with this
information, we propose using the {\alpha}-skew Jensen-Shannon divergence

the {\alpha}-JS regularization with both existing entropyregularization based

implies that not all scenarios encountered in deployment can be anticipated
during training, and therefore relying solely on advancements in training has
its limits. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important area that
stress-tests a model's ability to handle unseen situations: Do models know when
they don't know? Existing OOD detection methods either incur extra training
steps, additional data or make nontrivial modifications to the trained network.
In contrast, in this work, we propose an extremely simple, post-hoc, on-the-fly
activation shaping method, ASH, where a large portion (e.g. 90%) of a sample's
activation at a late layer is removed, and the rest (e.g. 10%) simplified or
lightly adjusted. The shaping is applied at inference time, and does not
require any statistics calculated from training data. Experiments show that
such a simple treatment enhances in-distribution and out-of-distribution sample
distinction so as to allow state-of-the-art OOD detection on ImageNet, and does
not noticeably deteriorate the in-distribution accuracy. We release alongside
the paper two calls for explanation and validation, believing the collective
power to further validate and understand the discovery. Calls, video and code

Different from such settings, we tackle a more practical problem of generating

design an attack strategy that can learn from such natural scenes by leveraging
the local patch differences that occur inherently in such images (e.g.
difference between the local patch on the object `person' and the object `bike'
in a traffic scene). Our key idea is: to misclassify an adversarial
multi-object image, each local patch in the image should confuse the victim
classifier. Based on this, we propose a novel generative attack (called Local

the aforesaid local differences in feature space of multi-object scenes to
optimize the perturbation generator. Through various experiments across diverse

messages. Many subsequent papers have attempted to model this phenomenon, with
most concentrating on the ""short chain"" of acquaintances rather than their
ability to efficiently route messages. In this paper, we study the small-world
navigability of the U.S. road network, with the goal of providing a model that
explains how messages in the original small-world experiments could be routed
along short paths using U.S. roads. To this end, we introduce the Neighborhood
Preferential Attachment model, which combines elements from Kleinberg's model

according to both the degrees and (road-network) distances of vertices in the

routing algorithm, where each vertex only has knowledge of its own neighbors,
and find that our model outperforms both of these models in terms of the
average hop length. Moreover, our experiments indicate that similar to the

with an on-the-fly adjustment on its capacity can better accommodate such a
time-varying task. A comprehensive empirical study confirms that the proposed
training strategy, termed as DynamicD, improves the synthesis performance
without incurring any additional computation cost or training objectives. Two
capacity adjusting schemes are developed for training GANs under different data
regimes: i) given a sufficient amount of training data, the discriminator
benefits from a progressively increased learning capacity, and ii) when the
training data is limited, gradually decreasing the layer width mitigates the
over-fitting issue of the discriminator. Experiments on both 2D and 3D-aware

generalizability of our DynamicD as well as its substantial improvement over

a versatile and controllable generative model is highly desired, where layman
users can intuitively control the generation process. However, existing
state-of-the-art methods still struggle to synthesize high-quality panoramas
for complex scenes. In this work, we propose a zero-shot text-driven framework,
Text2Light, to generate 4K+ resolution HDRIs without paired training data.
Given a free-form text as the description of the scene, we synthesize the
corresponding HDRI with two dedicated steps: 1) text-driven panorama generation
in low dynamic range(LDR) and low resolution, and 2) super-resolution inverse
tone mapping to scale up the LDR panorama both in resolution and dynamic range.
Specifically, to achieve zero-shot text-driven panorama generation, we first
build dual codebooks as the discrete representation for diverse environmental
textures. Then, driven by the pre-trained CLIP model, a text-conditioned global
sampler learns to sample holistic semantics from the global codebook according
to the input text. Furthermore, a structure-aware local sampler learns to
synthesize LDR panoramas patch-by-patch, guided by holistic semantics. To
achieve super-resolution inverse tone mapping, we derive a continuous
representation of 360-degree imaging from the LDR panorama as a set of
structured latent codes anchored to the sphere. This continuous representation
enables a versatile module to upscale the resolution and dynamic range
simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior capability of
Text2Light in generating high-quality HDR panoramas. In addition, we show the
feasibility of our work in realistic rendering and immersive VR.

multiplier, digital comparator (comparison operator), etc. Thus, the user could
implement a quantum algorithm by using these generic blocks, and the quantum
synthesizer would create a suitable circuit for this algorithm, in a format
that is supported by the chosen quantum computation environment. This approach
greatly simplifies the processes of development and debugging a quantum
algorithm. The proposed approach for implementing quantum algorithms has a
potential application in the field of machine learning, in this regard, we
provided an example of creating a circuit for training a simple neural network.
Neural networks have a significant impact on the technological development of
the transport and road complex, and there is a potential for improving the
reliability and efficiency of their learning process by utilizing quantum
computation, through the introduction of quantum computing.

and we would like to learn about the familiarity of a new user with an existing
item. This can be formulated as an anomaly detection (AD) problem
distinguishing between ""common users"" (nominal) and ""fresh users"" (anomalous).
Considering the sheer volume of items and the sparsity of user-item paired
data, independently applying conventional single-task detection methods on each
item quickly becomes difficult, while correlations between items are ignored.
To address this multi-task anomaly detection problem, we propose collaborative
anomaly detection (CAD) to jointly learn all tasks with an embedding encoding
correlations among tasks. We explore CAD with conditional density estimation
and conditional likelihood ratio estimation. We found that: $i$) estimating a
likelihood ratio enjoys more efficient learning and yields better results than
density estimation. $ii$) It is beneficial to select a small number of tasks in
advance to learn a task embedding model, and then use it to warm-start all task
embeddings. Consequently, these embeddings can capture correlations between
tasks and generalize to new correlated tasks.

Existing research on software maintenance has studied the issue-reporting needs

security issues. However, ML systems have specific classes of faults, and
reporting ML issues requires domain-specific information. Because of the
different characteristics between ML and traditional Software Engineering
systems, we do not know to what extent the reporting needs are different, and
to what extent these differences impact the issue resolution process.
Objective: Our objective is to investigate whether there is a discrepancy in
the distribution of resolution time between ML and non-ML issues and whether
certain categories of ML issues require a longer time to resolve based on real
issue reports in open-source applied ML projects. We further investigate the
size of fix of ML issues and non-ML issues. Method: We extract issues reports,
pull requests and code files in recent active applied ML projects from Github,
and use an automatic approach to filter ML and non-ML issues. We manually label
the issues using a known taxonomy of deep learning bugs. We measure the
resolution time and size of fix of ML and non-ML issues on a controlled sample

themselves in expeditions, gas industry, mines, warehouses, etc. However, even
legged robots may stuck in rough terrain conditions requiring human cognitive
abilities to navigate the system. While gamepads and keyboards are convenient

  In this paper we present HyperPalm: a novel gesture interface for intuitive
human-robot interaction with quadruped robots. Without additional devices, the
operator has full position and orientation control of the quadruped robot in 3D

of teaching quadruped robots navigation through user-guided path planning in
virtual reality (VR). Our system contains both global and local path planners,
allowing robot to generate path through iterations of learning. The VR
interface allows user to interact with environment and to assist quadruped
robot in challenging scenarios. The results of comparison experiments show that
cooperation between human and path planning algorithms can increase the

underlying Koopman operator or generator have proven to be successful tools for
forecasting, feature learning, state estimation, and control. It has become
well known that the Koopman generators for control-affine systems also have
affine dependence on the input, leading to convenient finite-dimensional
bilinear approximations of the dynamics. Yet there are still two main obstacles
that limit the scope of current approaches for approximating the Koopman
generators of systems with actuation. First, the performance of existing
methods depends heavily on the choice of basis functions over which the Koopman
generator is to be approximated; and there is currently no universal way to
choose them for systems that are not measure preserving. Secondly, if we do not
observe the full state, we may not gain access to a sufficiently rich
collection of such functions to describe the dynamics. This is because the
commonly used method of forming time-delayed observables fails when there is
actuation. To remedy these issues, we write the dynamics of observables
governed by the Koopman generator as a bilinear hidden Markov model, and
determine the model parameters using the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm. The E-step involves a standard Kalman filter and smoother, while the
M-step resembles control-affine dynamic mode decomposition for the generator.
We demonstrate the performance of this method on three examples, including
recovery of a finite-dimensional Koopman-invariant subspace for an actuated
system with a slow manifold; estimation of Koopman eigenfunctions for the
unforced Duffing equation; and model-predictive control of a fluidic pinball
system based only on noisy observations of lift and drag.

In particular, we visualize the loss landscapes of trained models and perform

Our findings suggest that existing methods produce highly non-convex loss
landscapes that are difficult to navigate. Furthermore, high-order PDEs
contaminate the backpropagated gradients that may impede or prevent
convergence. We then propose a novel method that bypasses the calculation of
high-order PDE operators and mitigates the contamination of backpropagating
gradients. In doing so, we reduce the dimension of the search space of our
solution and facilitate learning problems with non-smooth solutions. Our
formulation also provides a feedback mechanism that helps our model adaptively
focus on complex regions of the domain that are difficult to learn. We then
formulate an unconstrained dual problem by adapting the Lagrange multiplier
method. We apply our method to solve several challenging benchmark problems

find the optimal management practices given a specific planting environment and
a crop. Previous work used reinforcement learning (RL) and crop simulators to
solve the problem, but the trained policies either have limited performance or
are not deployable in the real world. In this paper, we present an intelligent
crop management system which optimizes the N fertilization and irrigation
simultaneously via RL, imitation learning (IL), and crop simulations using the
Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). We first use deep
RL, in particular, deep Q-network, to train management policies that require
all state information from the simulator as observations (denoted as full
observation). We then invoke IL to train management policies that only need a
limited amount of state information that can be readily obtained in the real

introduces novel challenges such as adversarial robustness and security. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to study questions including (i)
Whether PNet is more robust against adversarial inputs than regular neural
networks? (ii) How to design a robust PNet given the encrypted input without
decryption? We propose PNet-Attack to generate black-box adversarial examples
that can successfully attack PNet in both target and untarget manners. The
attack results show that PNet robustness against adversarial inputs needs to be
improved. This is not a trivial task because the PNet model owner does not have
access to the plaintext of the input values, which prevents the application of
existing detection and defense methods such as input tuning, model
normalization, and adversarial training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
new fast and accurate noise insertion method, called RPNet, to design Robust

multi-agent/robot tasks that inherently require agents/robots to asynchronously
reason about high-level action selection at varying time durations. The
Macro-Action Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process

this paper, we offer a different perspective towards answering these questions
-- we study the use of 3D sketches as an input modality and advocate a
VR-scenario where retrieval is conducted. Thus, the ultimate vision is that
users can freely retrieve a 3D model by air-doodling in a VR environment. As a
first stab at this new 3D VR-sketch to 3D shape retrieval problem, we make four
contributions. First, we code a VR utility to collect 3D VR-sketches and
conduct retrieval. Second, we collect the first set of $167$ 3D VR-sketches on
two shape categories from ModelNet. Third, we propose a novel approach to
generate a synthetic dataset of human-like 3D sketches of different abstract
levels to train deep networks. At last, we compare the common multi-view and
volumetric approaches: We show that, in contrast to 3D shape to 3D shape
retrieval, volumetric point-based approaches exhibit superior performance on 3D
sketch to 3D shape retrieval due to the sparse and abstract nature of 3D
VR-sketches. We believe these contributions will collectively serve as enablers

in-hand manipulation of a rigid object involving grasp changes using
fully-actuated multifingered robotic hands. While the framework can be applied
to the general dexterous manipulation, we focus on a more complex definition of
in-hand manipulation, where at the goal pose the hand has to reach a grasp
suitable for using the object as a tool. The high level planner determines the
object trajectory as well as the grasp changes, i.e. adding, removing, or
sliding fingers, to be executed by the low-level controller. While the grasp
sequence is planned online by a learning-based policy to adapt to variations,
the trajectory planner and the low-level controller for object tracking and
contact force control are exclusively model-based to robustly realize the plan.
By infusing the knowledge about the physics of the problem and the low-level
controller into the grasp planner, it learns to successfully generate grasps
similar to those generated by model-based optimization approaches, obviating
the high computation cost of online running of such methods to account for
variations. By performing experiments in physics simulation for realistic tool
use scenarios, we show the success of our method on different tool-use tasks

more robustness to trajectory and task variations compared to a model-based
method.

summaries overlap with the content of the inpatient records. However, it
remains unclear how the summaries should be generated from the unstructured
source. To decompose the physician's summarization process, this study aimed to
identify the optimal granularity in summarization. We first defined three types
of summarization units with different granularities to compare the performance
of the discharge summary generation: whole sentences, clinical segments, and
clauses. We defined clinical segments in this study, aiming to express the
smallest medically meaningful concepts. To obtain the clinical segments, it was
necessary to automatically split the texts in the first stage of the pipeline.
Accordingly, we compared rule-based methods and a machine learning method, and
the latter outperformed the formers with an F1 score of 0.846 in the splitting
task. Next, we experimentally measured the accuracy of extractive summarization
using the three types of units, based on the ROUGE-1 metric, on a

accuracies of extractive summarization using whole sentences, clinical
segments, and clauses were 31.91, 36.15, and 25.18, respectively. We found that
the clinical segments yielded higher accuracy than sentences and clauses. This
result indicates that summarization of inpatient records demands finer

health records, it can be interpreted as follows: physicians extract ""concepts
of medical significance"" from patient records and recombine them ...

based on labeled datasets. A standard scheme in external clustering validation
is to use class labels as ground truth clusters, based on the assumption that
each class forms a single, clearly separated cluster. However, as such
cluster-label matching (CLM) assumption often breaks, the lack of conducting a
sanity check for the CLM of benchmark datasets casts doubt on the validity of
external validations. Still, evaluating the degree of CLM is challenging. For
example, internal clustering validation measures can be used to quantify CLM
within the same dataset to evaluate its different clusterings but are not
designed to compare clusterings of different datasets. In this work, we propose
a principled way to generate between-dataset internal measures that enable the
comparison of CLM across datasets. We first determine four axioms for
between-dataset internal measures, complementing Ackerman and Ben-David's
within-dataset axioms. We then propose processes to generalize internal
measures to fulfill these new axioms, and use them to extend the widely used
Calinski-Harabasz index for between-dataset CLM evaluation. Through
quantitative experiments, we (1) verify the validity and necessity of the
generalization processes and (2) show that the proposed between-dataset

demonstrate the importance of evaluating CLM of benchmark datasets before

improving the performance of a DNN execution by providing flexibility in

a challenging task for DNN accelerators and hence a novel approach is required.
In this paper, we propose the In-Network Accumulation (INA) method to further
accelerate a DNN workload execution on a many-core spatial DNN accelerator for
the Weight Stationary (WS) dataflow model. The INA method expands the router's
function to support partial sum accumulation. This method avoids the overhead
of injecting and ejecting an incoming partial sum to the local processing

show that the proposed INA method achieves 1.22x improvement in latency and
2.16x improvement in power consumption on the WS dataflow model.

performances in many applications, and a key is the existence of well trained
classifiers on benchmark datasets. As a main-stream loss function, the cross
entropy can easily lead us to find models which demonstrate severe overfitting
behavior. In this paper, we show that the existing cross entropy loss
minimization problem essentially learns the label conditional entropy (CE) of
the underlying data distribution of the dataset. However, the CE learned in
this way does not characterize well the information shared by the label and the
input. In this paper, we propose a mutual information learning framework where
we train deep neural network classifiers via learning the mutual information
between the label and the input. Theoretically, we give the population
classification error lower bound in terms of the mutual information. In
addition, we derive the mutual information lower and upper bounds for a
concrete binary classification data model in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and also the error
probability lower bound in this scenario. Empirically, we conduct extensive
experiments on several benchmark datasets to support our theory. The mutual
information learned classifiers (MILCs) achieve far better generalization
performances than the conditional entropy learned classifiers (CELCs) with an
improvement which can exceed more than 10\% in testing accuracy.

solving knowledge-intensive tasks by replacing document retrievers with large

several decades. Historically, logistic regression has been used as a major
tool due to its compliance with regulatory requirements: transparency,
explainability, and fairness. In recent years, researchers have increasingly
used complex and advanced machine learning methods to improve prediction
accuracy. Even though a machine learning method could potentially improve the
model accuracy, it complicates simple logistic regression, deteriorates
explainability, and often violates fairness. In the absence of compliance with
regulatory requirements, even highly accurate machine learning methods are
unlikely to be accepted by companies for credit scoring. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of monotonic neural additive models, which meet
regulatory requirements by simplifying neural network architecture and
enforcing monotonicity. By utilizing the special architectural features of the
neural additive model, the monotonic neural additive model penalizes
monotonicity violations effectively. Consequently, the computational cost of
training a monotonic neural additive model is similar to that of training a
neural additive model, as a free lunch. We demonstrate through empirical
results that our new model is as accurate as black-box fully-connected neural
networks, providing a highly accurate and regulated machine learning method.

GLE. Stacking GLE modules enables the network to extract image features from
different image frequency components. This ability is important to maintain
structural and contextual integrity, for high frequency components correspond
to structural information while low frequency components correspond to
contextual information. The proposed network utilizes the GLE features to
progressively fill in missing regions in a corrupted image in an iterative
manner. Our benchmarking experiments demonstrate that the proposed method

efficiency of pavement maintenance and reducing the cost of labor and
resources. A recently influential branch of this task divides the pavement
image into patches and addresses these issues from the perspective of
multi-instance learning. However, these methods neglect the correlation between
patches and suffer from a low efficiency in the model optimization and
inference. Meanwhile, Swin Transformer is able to address both of these issues
with its unique strengths. Built upon Swin Transformer, we present a vision
Transformer named \textbf{P}avement \textbf{I}mage \textbf{C}lassification
\textbf{T}ransformer (\textbf{PicT}) for pavement distress classification. In
order to better exploit the discriminative information of pavement images at
the patch level, the \textit{Patch Labeling Teacher} is proposed to leverage a
teacher model to dynamically generate pseudo labels of patches from image
labels during each iteration, and guides the model to learn the discriminative
features of patches. The broad classification head of Swin Transformer may
dilute the discriminative features of distressed patches in the feature
aggregation step due to the small distressed area ratio of the pavement image.
To overcome this drawback, we present a \textit{Patch Refiner} to cluster
patches into different groups and only select the highest distress-risk group
to yield a slim head for the final image classification. We evaluate our method
on CQU-BPDD. Extensive results show that \textbf{PicT} outperforms the

probabilistic model that adapts its complexity to the training data. The UDN
contains an infinite sequence of hidden layers and places an unbounded prior on
a truncation L, the layer from which it produces its data. Given a dataset of
observations, the posterior UDN provides a conditional distribution of both the
parameters of the infinite neural network and its truncation. We develop a
novel variational inference algorithm to approximate this posterior, optimizing
a distribution of the neural network weights and of the truncation depth L, and
without any upper limit on L. To this end, the variational family has a special
structure: it models neural network weights of arbitrary depth, and it
dynamically creates or removes free variational parameters as its distribution
of the truncation is optimized. (Unlike heuristic approaches to model search,
it is solely through gradient-based optimization that this algorithm explores
the space of truncations.) We study the UDN on real and synthetic data. We find

signal estimation from noisy nonlinear measurements. We assume that the unknown
$p$-dimensional signal lies near the range of an $L$-Lipschitz continuous
generative model with bounded $k$-dimensional inputs. In particular, we
consider two cases when the nonlinear link function is either unknown or known.
For unknown nonlinearity, similarly to \cite{liu2020generalized}, we make the
assumption of sub-Gaussian observations and propose a linear least-squares
estimator. We show that when there is no representation error and the sensing
vectors are Gaussian, roughly $O(k \log L)$ samples suffice to ensure that a
PGD algorithm converges linearly to a point achieving the optimal statistical
rate using arbitrary initialization. For known nonlinearity, we assume
monotonicity as in \cite{yang2016sparse}, and make much weaker assumptions on
the sensing vectors and allow for representation error. We propose a nonlinear
least-squares estimator that is guaranteed to enjoy an optimal statistical
rate. A corresponding PGD algorithm is provided and is shown to also converge
linearly to the estimator using arbitrary initialization. In addition, we
present experimental results on image datasets to demonstrate the performance
of our PGD algorithms.

  Applications on Naive Bayes",Submitted to Pattern Recognition for review,,,,cs.LG cs.DM cs.IT math.IT,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In many classification models, data is discretized to better estimate its
distribution. Existing discretization methods often target at maximizing the
discriminant power of discretized data, while overlooking the fact that the
primary target of data discretization in classification is to improve the
generalization performance. As a result, the data tend to be over-split into
many small bins since the data without discretization retain the maximal
discriminant information. Thus, we propose a Max-Dependency-Min-Divergence
(MDmD) criterion that maximizes both the discriminant information and
generalization ability of the discretized data. More specifically, the
Max-Dependency criterion maximizes the statistical dependency between the
discretized data and the classification variable while the Min-Divergence
criterion explicitly minimizes the JS-divergence between the training data and
the validation data for a given discretization scheme. The proposed MDmD
criterion is technically appealing, but it is difficult to reliably estimate
the high-order joint distributions of attributes and the classification
variable. We hence further propose a more practical solution,
Max-Relevance-Min-Divergence (MRmD) discretization scheme, where each attribute
is discretized separately, by simultaneously maximizing the discriminant
information and the generalization ability of the discretized data. The
proposed MRmD is compared with the state-of-the-art discretization algorithms
under the naive Bayes classification framework on 45 machine-learning benchmark
datasets. It significantly outperforms all the compared methods on most of the

Electromagnetic field simulation is critical to the design, optimization, and
validation of photonic devices and circuits. However, costly numerical
simulation significantly hinders the scalability and turn-around time in the
photonic circuit design loop. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have
been proposed to predict the optical field solution of a single instance of a
partial differential equation (PDE) with predefined parameters. Their
complicated PDE formulation and lack of efficient parametrization mechanisms
limit their flexibility and generalization in practical simulation scenarios.
In this work, for the first time, a physics-agnostic neural operator-based
framework, dubbed NeurOLight, is proposed to learn a family of frequency-domain
Maxwell PDEs for ultra-fast parametric photonic device simulation. We balance
the efficiency and generalization of NeurOLight via several novel techniques.
Specifically, we discretize different devices into a unified domain, represent
parametric PDEs with a compact wave prior, and encode the incident light via
masked source modeling. We design our model with parameter-efficient
cross-shaped NeurOLight blocks and adopt superposition-based augmentation for
data-efficient learning. With these synergistic approaches, NeurOLight
generalizes to a large space of unseen simulation settings, demonstrates
2-orders-of-magnitude faster simulation speed than numerical solvers, and
outperforms prior neural network models by ~54% lower prediction error with
~44% fewer parameters. Our code is available at

learning with its broad practical applications. A typical application of LP is
to retrieve the top scoring neighbors for a given source node, such as the
friend recommendation. These services desire the high inference scalability to
find the top scoring neighbors from many candidate nodes at low latencies.
There are two popular decoders that the recent LP models mainly use to compute
the edge scores from node embeddings: the HadamardMLP and Dot Product decoders.
After theoretical and empirical analysis, we find that the HadamardMLP decoders
are generally more effective for LP. However, HadamardMLP lacks the scalability
for retrieving top scoring neighbors on large graphs, since to the best of our
knowledge, there does not exist an algorithm to retrieve the top scoring
neighbors for HadamardMLP decoders in sublinear complexity. To make HadamardMLP
scalable, we propose the Flashlight algorithm to accelerate the top scoring
neighbor retrievals for HadamardMLP: a sublinear algorithm that progressively
applies approximate maximum inner product search (MIPS) techniques with
adaptively adjusted query embeddings. Empirical results show that Flashlight
improves the inference speed of LP by more than 100 times on the large

significantly impact decisions and requires consensus among agents. Moreover,
most existing works have focused on developing approaches for (either strongly
or non-strongly) convex losses, and very few results have been obtained
regarding regret bounds in distributed online optimization for general
non-convex losses. To address these two issues, we propose a novel composite
regret with a new network regret-based metric to evaluate distributed online
optimization algorithms. We concretely define static and dynamic forms of the
composite regret. By leveraging the dynamic form of our composite regret, we
develop a consensus-based online normalized gradient (CONGD) approach for
pseudo-convex losses, and it provably shows a sublinear behavior relating to a
regularity term for the path variation of the optimizer. For general non-convex
losses, we first shed light on the regret for the setting of distributed online
non-convex learning based on recent advances such that no deterministic
algorithm can achieve the sublinear regret. We then develop the distributed
online non-convex optimization with composite regret (DINOCO) without access to
the gradients, depending on an offline optimization oracle. DINOCO is shown to
achieve sublinear regret; to our knowledge, this is the first regret bound for
general distributed online non-convex learning.

film for spin-wave transmission. For various nonlinear and fading-memory
dynamic phenomena distributing in the film space, small in-plane magnetic
fields were used to prepare stripe domain structures and various damping
constants at the film sides and bottom were explored. The ferromagnetic
resonant frequency and relaxation time of spin precession clearly characterized
the change in spin dynamics with the magnetic field and damping constant. The
common input signal for reservoir computing was a 1 GHz cosine wave with random
6-valued amplitude modulation. A basic 120-dimensional reservoir output vector
was obtained from time-series signals at the 120 output detectors under each of
the three magnetic field conditions. Then, 240- and 360-dimensional reservoir
output vectors were also constructed by concatenating two and three basic ones,
respectively. In nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA) prediction
tasks, the computational performance was enhanced as the dimension of the
reservoir output vector becomes higher and a significantly low prediction error
was achieved for the 10th-order NARMA using the 360-dimensional vector and
optimum damping constant. The results are clear evidence that the collection of

shown great promise to revolutionize finance and commerce. Although they are
gaining increasing popularity, they face technical challenges when it comes to
scaling to support greater demand while maintaining their desirable security
properties. In an exciting line of recent work, many researchers have proposed
various scalable blockchain protocols that demonstrate the potential to solve
these challenges. However, many of these protocols come with the assumptions of
honest majority and symmetric network access which may not accurately reflect
the real world where the participants may be self-interested or rational.
Secondly, these works show that their protocol works in an ideal environment
where each party has equal access to the network whereas different parties have
varying latencies and network speeds. These assumptions may render the
protocols susceptible to security threats in the real world, as highlighted by
the literature focused on exploring game-theoretic attacks on these protocols.
  We propose a scalable blockchain protocol, Interlude, which comes with the
typical security guarantees while focusing on game-theoretic soundness and
network fairness. The novelty of Interlude is that it has a relatively simple
design consisting of a sequence of parallel blocks containing disjoint
transaction sets that can be mined quickly followed by a series block that is
slow to mine and gives the honest parties in the network time to synchronize.
Thus, between the chaos of parallel blocks, our blockchain protocol masquerades
an interlude moment of harmony in series blocks that synchronize the network.

with the aim of achieving various trade-offs between robustness and speed of
convergence. We assume that a robust nominal observer has been designed for a
general nonlinear system and the goal is to improve its performance. We present
for this purpose a novel hybrid multi-observer, which consists of the nominal
one and a bank of additional observer-like systems, that are collectively
referred to as modes and that differ from the nominal observer only in their
output injection gains. We then evaluate on-line the estimation cost of each
mode of the multi-observer and, based on these costs, we select one of them at
each time instant. Two different strategies are proposed. In the first one,
initial conditions of the modes are reset each time the algorithm switches
between different modes. In the second one, the initial conditions are not
reset. We prove a convergence property for the hybrid estimation scheme and we
illustrate the efficiency of the approach in improving the performance of a

that requires agents to (1) extract key events in completing the dish and (2)
generate sentences for the extracted events. Our task is similar to dense video
captioning (DVC), which aims at detecting events thoroughly and generating
sentences for them. However, unlike DVC, in recipe generation, recipe story
awareness is crucial, and a model should output an appropriate number of key
events in the correct order. We analyze the output of the DVC model and observe
that although (1) several events are adoptable as a recipe story, (2) the
generated sentences for such events are not grounded in the visual content.
Based on this, we hypothesize that we can obtain correct recipes by selecting
oracle events from the output events of the DVC model and re-generating
sentences for them. To achieve this, we propose a novel transformer-based joint
approach of training event selector and sentence generator for selecting oracle
events from the outputs of the DVC model and generating grounded sentences for
the events, respectively. In addition, we extend the model by including
ingredients to generate more accurate recipes. The experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art DVC models. We also
confirm that, by modeling the recipe in a story-aware manner, the proposed

the error between the LDG solution and the true solution is proved to converge,

explicitly defining the reward function from demonstrations. GAIL has the
potential to learn policies with high-dimensional observations as input, e.g.,
images. By applying GAIL to a real robot, perhaps robot policies can be
obtained for daily activities like washing, folding clothes, cooking, and
cleaning. However, human demonstration data are often imperfect due to
mistakes, which degrade the performance of the resulting policies. We address
this issue by focusing on the following features: 1) many robotic tasks are
goal-reaching tasks, and 2) labeling such goal states in demonstration data is
relatively easy. With these in mind, this paper proposes Goal-Aware Generative
Adversarial Imitation Learning (GA-GAIL), which trains a policy by introducing
a second discriminator to distinguish the goal state in parallel with the first
discriminator that indicates the demonstration data. This extends a standard
GAIL framework to more robustly learn desirable policies even from imperfect
demonstrations through a goal-state discriminator that promotes achieving the
goal state. Furthermore, GA-GAIL employs the Entropy-maximizing Deep P-Network
(EDPN) as a generator, which considers both the smoothness and causal entropy
in the policy update, to achieve stable policy learning from two
discriminators. Our proposed method was successfully applied to two
real-robotic cloth-manipulation tasks: turning a handkerchief over and folding
clothes. We confirmed that it learns cloth-manipulation policies without
task-specific reward function design. Video of the real experiments are

$d$ using a product of unitary matrices of size $2\times 2$, parameterized by
$(d+1)$ real numbers called the phase factors. This innovative representation
of polynomials has a wide range of applications in quantum computation. When
the polynomial of interest is obtained by truncating an infinite polynomial
series, a natural question is whether the phase factors have a well defined
limit as the degree $d\to \infty$. While the phase factors are generally not
unique, we find that there exists a consistent choice of parameterization so
that the limit is well defined in the $\ell^1$ space. This generalization of
QSP, called the infinite quantum signal processing, can be used to represent a
large class of non-polynomial functions. Our analysis reveals a surprising
connection between the regularity of the target function and the decay
properties of the phase factors. Our analysis also inspires a very simple and
efficient algorithm to approximately compute the phase factors in the $\ell^1$
space. The algorithm uses only double precision arithmetic operations, and
provably converges when the $\ell^1$ norm of the Chebyshev coefficients of the
target function is upper bounded by a constant that is independent of $d$. This
is also the first numerically stable algorithm for finding phase factors with
provable performance guarantees in the limit $d\to \infty$.

behaviors by modeling how users transit among items. However, the short
interaction sequences limit the performance of existing SR. To solve this
problem, we focus on Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) in this
paper, which aims to leverage information from other domains to improve the
sequential recommendation performance of a single domain. Solving CDSR is
challenging. On the one hand, how to retain single domain preferences as well
as integrate cross-domain influence remains an essential problem. On the other
hand, the data sparsity problem cannot be totally solved by simply utilizing
knowledge from other domains, due to the limited length of the merged
sequences. To address the challenges, we propose DDGHM, a novel framework for
the CDSR problem, which includes two main modules, i.e., dual dynamic graph
modeling and hybrid metric training. The former captures intra-domain and
inter-domain sequential transitions through dynamically constructing two-level
graphs, i.e., the local graphs and the global graph, and incorporating them
with a fuse attentive gating mechanism. The latter enhances user and item
representations by employing hybrid metric learning, including collaborative
metric for achieving alignment and contrastive metric for preserving
uniformity, to further alleviate data sparsity issue and improve prediction
accuracy. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets and the results
demonstrate the effectiveness of DDHMG.

pose huge threats to benign users. Recent semi-supervised GAD methods, which
can effectively leverage the available labels as prior knowledge, have achieved
superior performances than unsupervised methods. In practice, people usually
need to identify anomalies on new (sub)graphs to secure their business, but
they may lack labels to train an effective detection model. One natural idea is
to directly adopt a trained GAD model to the new (sub)graph for testing.
However, we find that existing semi-supervised GAD methods suffer from poor
generalization issue, i.e., well-trained models could not perform well on an
unseen area (i.e., not accessible in training) of the same graph. It may cause
great troubles. In this paper, we base on the phenomenon and propose a general
and novel research problem of generalized graph anomaly detection that aims to
effectively identify anomalies on both the training-domain graph and unseen
testing graph to eliminate potential dangers. Nevertheless, it is a challenging
task since only limited labels are available, and the normal background may
differ between training and testing data. Accordingly, we propose a data
augmentation method named \textit{AugAN} (\uline{Aug}mentation for

boost the generalizability of GAD models. Experiments verify the effectiveness

emotions in videos through text, speech, and rich facial expressions.
Multimodal video emotion analysis techniques can help understand users' inner
world automatically based on human expressions and gestures in images, tones in
voices, and recognized natural language. However, in the existing research, the
acoustic modality has long been in a marginal position as compared to visual
and textual modalities. That is, it tends to be more difficult to improve the
contribution of the acoustic modality for the whole multimodal emotion
recognition task. Besides, although better performance can be obtained by
introducing common deep learning methods, the complex structures of these
training models always result in low inference efficiency, especially when
exposed to high-resolution and long-length videos. Moreover, the lack of a
fully end-to-end multimodal video emotion recognition system hinders its
application. In this paper, we designed a fully multimodal video-to-emotion

benefits are threefold: (1) The adoption of the hierarchical attention method
upon the sound spectra breaks through the limited contribution of the acoustic
modality and outperforms the existing models' performance on both IEMOCAP and
CMU-MOSEI datasets; (2) the introduction of the idea of multi-scale for visual

learns a model that explicitly predicts how well a 3D urban scene will be
reconstructed from a set of viewpoints. To make such a model trainable and
simultaneously applicable to drone path planning, we simulate the proxy-based
3D scene reconstruction during training to set up the prediction. Specifically,
the neural network we design is trained to predict the scene reconstructability
as a function of the proxy geometry, a set of viewpoints, and optionally a
series of scene images acquired in flight. To reconstruct a new urban scene, we
first build the 3D scene proxy, then rely on the predicted reconstruction
quality and uncertainty measures by our network, based off of the proxy
geometry, to guide the drone path planning. We demonstrate that our data-driven
reconstructability predictions are more closely correlated to the true
reconstruction quality than prior heuristic measures. Further, our learned
predictor can be easily integrated into existing path planners to yield

framework, and it is employed to solve the inverse problems in which the
unknown quantity is propagated through partial differential equations (PDEs),
especially the identification of the unknown field (e.g., space function) of a
given physical system. Compared with other data-driven approaches, the
suggested method is more than straightforward to implement, and also obtains
high-quality uncertainty estimates of the quantity of interest (QoI) without
significantly increasing the complexity of the algorithm. This work discusses
the good properties of ensemble learning in field inversion and uncertainty
quantification. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated
through several numerical experiments. To enhance the robustness of models,
adversarial training (AT) is applied. Furthermore, an adaptive active sampling
(AS) strategy based on the uncertainty estimates from E-PINNs is also proposed
to improve the accuracy of material field inversion problems.

  Off-the-Shelf DRAM Chips","To appear in the 55th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on
  Microarchitecture (MICRO), 2022",,,,cs.AR cs.CR,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  DRAM is the building block of modern main memory systems. DRAM cells must be
periodically refreshed to prevent data loss. Refresh operations degrade system
performance by interfering with memory accesses. As DRAM chip density increases
with technology node scaling, refresh operations also increase because: 1) the
number of DRAM rows in a chip increases; and 2) DRAM cells need additional
refresh operations to mitigate bit failures caused by RowHammer, a failure
mechanism that becomes worse with technology node scaling. Thus, it is critical
to enable refresh operations at low performance overhead. To this end, we
propose a new operation, Hidden Row Activation (HiRA), and the HiRA Memory
Controller (HiRA-MC).
  HiRA hides a refresh operation's latency by refreshing a row concurrently
with accessing or refreshing another row within the same bank. Unlike prior
works, HiRA achieves this parallelism without any modifications to
off-the-shelf DRAM chips. To do so, it leverages the new observation that two
rows in the same bank can be activated without data loss if the rows are
connected to different charge restoration circuitry. We experimentally
demonstrate on 56% real off-the-shelf DRAM chips that HiRA can reliably
parallelize a DRAM row's refresh operation with refresh or activation of any of
the 32% of the rows within the same bank. By doing so, HiRA reduces the overall
latency of two refresh operations by 51.4%.
  HiRA-MC modifies the memory request scheduler to perform HiRA when a refresh
operation can be performed concurrently with a memory access or another
refresh. Our system-level evaluations show that HiRA-MC increases system
performance by 12.6% and 3.73x as it reduces the performance degradation due to
periodic refreshes and refreshes for RowHammer protection (preventive
refreshes), respectively, for future DRAM chips with increased density and
RowHammer vulnerability.

  Wireless Networks",,,,,cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  This paper considers improving wireless communication and computation
efficiency in federated learning (FL) via model quantization. In the proposed
bitwidth FL scheme, edge devices train and transmit quantized versions of their
local FL model parameters to a coordinating server, which, in turn, aggregates
them into a quantized global model and synchronizes the devices. The goal is to
jointly determine the bitwidths employed for local FL model quantization and
the set of devices participating in FL training at each iteration. This problem
is posed as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the training loss
of quantized FL under a per-iteration device sampling budget and delay
requirement. To derive the solution, an analytical characterization is
performed in order to show how the limited wireless resources and induced
quantization errors affect the performance of the proposed FL method. The
analytical results show that the improvement of FL training loss between two
consecutive iterations depends on the device selection and quantization scheme
as well as on several parameters inherent to the model being learned. Given
linear regression-based estimates of these model properties, it is shown that
the FL training process can be described as a Markov decision process (MDP),
and, then, a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) method is proposed to
optimize action selection over iterations. Compared to model-free RL, this
model-based RL approach leverages the derived mathematical characterization of
the FL training process to discover an effective device selection and
quantization scheme without imposing additional device communication overhead.
Simulation results show that the proposed FL algorithm can reduce 29% and 63%
convergence time compared to a model free RL method and the standard FL method,
respectively.

it as an optimization problem using the generalized median. Previous methods
like the Prototype and Distance-Preserving Embedding methods transform objects
into a vector space, solve the generalized median problem in this space, and
inversely transform back into the original space. Both of these methods have
been successfully applied to a wide range of object domains, where the
generalized median problem has inherent high computational complexity
(typically $\mathcal{NP}$-hard) and therefore approximate solutions are
required. Previously, explicit embedding methods were used in the computation,
which often do not reflect the spatial relationship between objects exactly. In
this work we introduce a kernel-based generalized median framework that is
applicable to both positive definite and indefinite kernels. This framework
computes the relationship between objects and its generalized median in kernel
space, without the need of an explicit embedding. We show that the spatial
relationship between objects is more accurately represented in kernel space
than in an explicit vector space using easy-to-compute kernels, and demonstrate
superior performance of generalized median computation on datasets of three
different domains. A software toolbox resulting from our work is made publicly
available to encourage other researchers to explore the generalized median
computation and applications.

is estimated from the weight of the character, its current balance, the foot
speed at the time of contact, and the nature of the ground. We rely on a
standard stress-strain relationship to compute the dynamic deformation of the
soil under this force, where the amount of compression and lateral displacement
of material are, respectively, parameterized by the soil's Young modulus and
Poisson ratio. The resulting footprint is efficiently applied to the terrain
through procedural deformations of refined terrain patches, while the addition
of a simple controller on top of a kinematic character enables capturing the

  Image Classification",,,,,eess.IV cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Medical image classification has developed rapidly under the impetus of the
convolutional neural network (CNN). Due to the fixed size of the receptive
field of the convolution kernel, it is difficult to capture the global features
of medical images. Although the self-attention-based Transformer can model
long-range dependencies, it has high computational complexity and lacks local
inductive bias. Much research has demonstrated that global and local features
are crucial for image classification. However, medical images have a lot of
noisy, scattered features, intra-class variation, and inter-class similarities.
This paper proposes a three-branch hierarchical multi-scale feature fusion
network structure termed as HiFuse for medical image classification as a new
method. It can fuse the advantages of Transformer and CNN from multi-scale
hierarchies without destroying the respective modeling so as to improve the
classification accuracy of various medical images. A parallel hierarchy of
local and global feature blocks is designed to efficiently extract local
features and global representations at various semantic scales, with the
flexibility to model at different scales and linear computational complexity
relevant to image size. Moreover, an adaptive hierarchical feature fusion block
(HFF block) is designed to utilize the features obtained at different
hierarchical levels comprehensively. The HFF block contains spatial attention,
channel attention, residual inverted MLP, and shortcut to adaptively fuse
semantic information between various scale features of each branch. The
accuracy of our proposed model on the ISIC2018 dataset is 7.6% higher than
baseline, 21.5% on the Covid-19 dataset, and 10.4% on the Kvasir dataset.

finetuning the entire weights of the neural network to meet the fairness
criteria. However, this is often infeasible in practice for those large-scale
trained models due to large computational and storage costs, low data
efficiency, and model privacy issues. In this paper, we propose a new generic
fairness learning paradigm, called FairReprogram, which incorporates the model
reprogramming technique. Specifically, FairReprogram considers the neural model
fixed, and instead appends to the input a set of perturbations, called the
fairness trigger, which is tuned towards the fairness criteria under a min-max
formulation. We further introduce an information-theoretic framework that
explains why and under what conditions fairness goals can be achieved using the
fairness trigger. We show both theoretically and empirically that the fairness
trigger can effectively obscure demographic biases in the output prediction of
fixed ML models by providing false demographic information that hinders the
model from utilizing the correct demographic information to make the
prediction. Extensive experiments on both NLP and CV datasets demonstrate that
our method can achieve better fairness improvements than retraining-based

annotations of emotion to provide fine-grained descriptions of spontaneous
expressions as observed in real-life interactions. As emotion is rather
subjective, its annotation is usually performed by several annotators who
provide a trace for a given dimension, i.e. a time-continuous series describing
a dimension such as arousal or valence. However, annotations of the same
expression are rarely consistent between annotators, either in time or in
value, which adds bias and delay in the trace that is used to learn predictive
models of emotion. We therefore propose a method that can dynamically
compensate inconsistencies across annotations and synchronise the traces with
the corresponding acoustic features using Recurrent Neural Networks.
Experimental evaluations were carried on several emotion data sets that include
Chinese, French, German, and Hungarian participants who interacted remotely in
either noise-free conditions or in-the-wild. The results show that our method
can significantly increase inter-annotator agreement, as well as correlation
between traces and audio features, for both arousal and valence. In addition,
improvements are obtained in the automatic prediction of these dimensions using
simple light-weight models, especially for valence in noise-free conditions,

Abstract presented at EURO 2022 (Espoo, Finland)",,,,cs.SI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Social networks are the natural space for the spreading of information and
influence and have become a media themselves. Several models capturing that
diffusion process have been proposed, most of them based on the Independent
Cascade (IC) model or on the Linear Threshold (LT) model. The IC model is
probabilistic while the LT model relies on the knowledge of an actor to be
convinced, reflected in an associated individual threshold.
  Although the LT-based models contemplate an individual threshold for each
actor in the network, the existing studies so far have always considered a
threshold of 0.5 equal in all actors (i.e., a simple majority activation
criterion).
  Our main objective in this work is to start the study on how the
dissemination of information on networks behaves when we consider other options
for setting those thresholds and how many network actors end up being
influenced by this dissemination. For doing so, we consider a recently
introduced centrality measure based on the LT model, the Forward Linear
Threshold Rank (FLTR). We analyze experimentally the ranking properties for
several networks in which the influence resistance threshold follows different
schemes. Here we consider three different schemes: (1) uniform, in which all
players have the same value; (2) random, where each player is assigned a
threshold u.a.r. in a prescribed interval; and (3) determined by the value of
another centrality measure on the actor. Our results show that the selection
has a clear impact on the ranking, even quite significant and abrupt in some
cases. We conclude that the social networks ranks that provide the best
assignments for the individual thresholds are PageRank and FLTR.

individual robot movements within 3D space, but also patterns of movements
which could lead to inferring the purpose of the movements (i.e. surgical
procedures which a surgical robot is undertaking) and hence, resulting in
potential privacy violations. Upon evaluation, we find that individual robot
movements can be fingerprinted with around 75% accuracy, decreasing slightly
with more fine-grained movement meta-data such as distance and speed.
Furthermore, workflows could be reconstructed with around 62% accuracy as a

understanding complex systems, but also proposes unprecedented computational
challenges. In this work, we focus on the problem of counting occurrences of
sub-hypergraph patterns in very large higher-order networks. We show that, by
directly exploiting higher-order structures, we speed up the counting process
compared to applying traditional data mining techniques for network motifs.
Moreover, by including hyperedge sampling techniques, computational complexity
is further reduced at the cost of small errors in the estimation of motif
frequency. We evaluate our algorithms on several real-world datasets describing
face-to-face interactions, co-authorship and human communication. We show that
our approximated algorithm not only allows to speed up the performance, but
also to extract larger higher-order motifs beyond the computational limits of
an exact approach.

  Level Parallelism",,,,,cs.DC,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  Heterogeneous computing is becoming mainstream in all scopes. This new era in
computer architecture brings a new paradigm called Accelerator Level
Parallelism (ALP). In ALP, accelerators are used concurrently to provide
unprecedented levels of performance and energy efficiency. To reach that, there
are many problems to be solved, one of the most challenging being co-execution.
  This paper develops a scheduling framework called POAS, a general method for
providing co-execution to generic applications. Unlike other scheduling
approaches, POAS does not directly schedule applications. Instead, it is a
generic model that transforms any application to make it suitable for
co-execution, so that it can be executed in ALP environments. Our proposal is
composed of four differentiated steps: predict, optimize, adapt and schedule.
During these phases, different modifications are implemented in the application
to make it suitable to be executed in ALP environments. In this work we also
apply our framework to a matrix multiplication case study, outlining the
critical and most important steps to port the application with POAS.
  We evaluate our POAS-based implementation for matrix multiplication on a
CPU/GPU/XPU environment using CPU cores, CUDA cores and tensor cores (XPU). Our
experiments prove that co-execution in the studied scenario can benefit from
ALP, yielding speedups of up to 45% with respect to using only one accelerator.
The proven flexibility and potential of POAS make it an excellent candidate to
reach ALP in future computer systems.

camera-based 3D object detection methods fall into the performance bottleneck.
Intuitively, leveraging temporal multi-view stereo (MVS) technology is the
natural knowledge for tackling this ambiguity. However, traditional attempts of
MVS are flawed in two aspects when applying to 3D object detection scenes: 1)
The affinity measurement among all views suffers expensive computation cost; 2)
It is difficult to deal with outdoor scenarios where objects are often mobile.
To this end, we introduce an effective temporal stereo method to dynamically
select the scale of matching candidates, enable to significantly reduce
computation overhead. Going one step further, we design an iterative algorithm
to update more valuable candidates, making it adaptive to moving candidates. We
instantiate our proposed method to multi-view 3D detector, namely BEVStereo.
BEVStereo achieves the new state-of-the-art performance (i.e., 52.5% mAP and
61.0% NDS) on the camera-only track of nuScenes dataset. Meanwhile, extensive

approaches for model-based testing. However, EFSM-based test case generation is
susceptible to the infeasible (inexecutable) path problem, which stems from the
conflict of predicates (guards) between transitions in the path. Therefore, in
order to derive feasible test cases, a test generation algorithm needs to
dynamically acquire information about the model and verify the feasibility of
the generated test path through the simulation execution of the model. The
traditional method of constructing executable models using hard-coding for
different EFSM models under test has limitations such as inflexibility,
time-consuming and error-prone. To address this issue, this paper develops an
open source test generation tool for testing EFSM-specified systems, PTSG, to
support the automatic generation of executable test cases. It decouples the
EFSM model description, parsing and simulation execution functions from the
test generation algorithm, which can effectively improve the efficiency and
quality of test generation. In particular, PTSG first uses a well-designed JSON
syntax to describe the specific EFSM under test. Then, based on the model
description file, it uses lexical and syntactic parsers to dynamically extract
model information to construct various model objects in memory such as state
configurations, transitions, etc. Finally, the tool provide a series of service
interfaces to support model information acquisition, transition feasibility
evaluation, and model simulation execution. A case study of test sequence
generation for the SCP protocol model demonstrates the capability and promise
of the PTSG to serve executable test cases.

which preserve a sufficient level of connectivity despite the failure or
removal of a few nodes or edges. One of the most basic problems in this area is
the $2$-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph problem (2-ECSS): given an undirected
graph $G$, find a $2$-edge-connected spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$ with the
minimum number of edges (in particular, $H$ remains connected after the removal
of one arbitrary edge).
  2-ECSS is NP-hard and the best-known (polynomial-time) approximation factor
for this problem is $4/3$. Interestingly, this factor was achieved with
drastically different techniques by [Hunkenschr{\""o}der, Vempala and Vetta

$\frac{118}{89}+\epsilon<1.326$ approximation for 2-ECSS.
  The key ingredient in our approach (which might also be helpful in future
work) is a reduction to a special type of structured graphs: our reduction
preserves approximation factors up to $6/5$. While reducing to
2-vertex-connected graphs is trivial (and heavily used in prior work), our
structured graphs are ""almost"" 3-vertex-connected: more precisely, given any
2-vertex-cut $\{u,v\}$ of a structured graph $G=(V,E)$, $G[V\setminus \{u,v\}]$
has exactly 2 connected components, one of which contains exactly one node of

activities at Bellingcat on Twitter. For this, we built a comprehensive dataset

Twitter to disseminate information and collect information from its follower
base. Here, we find a steady increase in both posts and replies over time,

importance of Bellingcat for the traditional media ecosystem. (2) We identify
characteristics of posts that are successful in eliciting user engagement. User
engagement is particularly large for posts embedding additional media items and

responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Here, we find that the sentiment
has become more polarized and negative. We attribute this to a ~13-fold

2209.10291,Christian Rieck,Christian Rieck and Christian Scheffer,The Dispersive Art Gallery Problem,"20 pages, 17 figures, full version of an extended abstract accepted
  for publication in the proceedings of the 33rd International Symposium on
  Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC 2022)",,,,cs.CG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We introduce a new variant of the art gallery problem that comes from safety
issues. In this variant we are not interested in guard sets of smallest
cardinality, but in guard sets with largest possible distances between these
guards. To the best of our knowledge, this variant has not been considered
before.We call it the Dispersive Art Gallery Problem. In particular, in the
dispersive art gallery problem we are given a polygon $\mathcal{P}$ and a real
number $\ell$, and want to decide whether $\mathcal{P}$ has a guard set such
that every pair of guards in this set is at least a distance of $\ell$ apart.
  In this paper, we study the vertex guard variant of this problem for the
class of polyominoes. We consider rectangular visibility and distances as
geodesics in the $L_1$-metric. Our results are as follows. We give a (simple)
thin polyomino such that every guard set has minimum pairwise distances of at
most $3$. On the positive side, we describe an algorithm that computes guard
sets for simple polyominoes that match this upper bound, i.e., the algorithm
constructs worst-case optimal solutions. We also study the computational
complexity of computing guard sets that maximize the smallest distance between
all pairs of guards within the guard sets. We prove that deciding whether there
exists a guard set realizing a minimum pairwise distance for all pairs of
guards of at least $5$ in a given polyomino is NP-complete.
  We were also able to find an optimal dynamic programming approach that
computes a guard set that maximizes the minimum pairwise distance between
guards in tree-shaped polyominoes, i.e., computes optimal solutions. Because
the shapes constructed in the NP-hardness reduction are thin as well (but have
holes), this result completes the case for thin polyominoes.

  Prediction",Accepted to ICADL'22,,,,cs.CY cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  With the rising participation of the common mass in social media, it is
increasingly common now for policymakers/journalists to create online polls on
social media to understand the political leanings of people in specific
locations. The caveat here is that only influential people can make such an
online polling and reach out at a mass scale. Further, in such cases, the
distribution of voters is not controllable and may be, in fact, biased. On the
other hand,if we can interpret the publicly available data over social media to
probe the political inclination of users, we will be able to have controllable
insights about the survey population, keep the cost of survey low and also
collect publicly available data without involving the concerned persons. Hence
we introduce a self-attentive semi-supervised framework for political
inclination detection to further that objective. The advantage of our model is
that it neither needs huge training data nor does it need to store social
network parameters. Nevertheless, it achieves an accuracy of 93.7\% with no
annotated data; further, with only a few annotated examples per class it
achieves competitive performance.
  We found that the model is highly efficient even in resource-constrained
settings, and insights drawn from its predictions match the manual survey
outcomes when applied to diverse real-life scenarios.

problem of blockchain. By establishing channels off the blockchain to form
payment channel networks (PCNs), users can make instant payments without
interacting with the blockchain, avoiding the problems of long transaction
consensus delays and high transaction fees. Recently, the optimization of PCNs
has mainly focused on improving the network throughput via multi-path routing.
However, the transaction's atomicity comes at a non-trivial cost for
transaction completion latency that affects user experience in
deadline-sensitive applications of PCNs, which is ignored by previous work. For
the first time, we propose a new framework DPCN to consider the deadlines of
transactions for payment channel networks while improving the success ratio of
transactions. DPCN is enabled via a synergy of three components: (1)
deadline-based dynamic transaction split mechanism that splits the transaction
according to current network status and the transaction's deadline;
(2)deadline-aware transaction scheduling that prioritizes near-deadline
transactions; (3) deadline-aware transaction congestion avoidance algorithm,
which uses a path window to balance transactions with different deadlines. Our
extensive experiments show that compared with existing methods, DPCN can well
meet the needs of transactions with different deadlines and ensure a higher
success ratio for transactions in the payment channel networks.

existing methods still rely on human-annotated attributes, which are difficult
to annotate and scale. An unsupervised alternative is to represent each class
using the word embedding associated with its semantic class name. However, word
embeddings extracted from pre-trained language models do not necessarily
capture visual similarities, resulting in poor zero-shot performance. In this
work, we argue that online textual documents, e.g., Wikipedia, contain rich
visual descriptions about object classes, therefore can be used as powerful
unsupervised side information for ZSL. To this end, we propose I2DFormer, a
novel transformer-based ZSL framework that jointly learns to encode images and
documents by aligning both modalities in a shared embedding space. In order to
distill discriminative visual words from noisy documents, we introduce a new
cross-modal attention module that learns fine-grained interactions between
image patches and document words. Consequently, our I2DFormer not only learns
highly discriminative document embeddings that capture visual similarities but
also gains the ability to localize visually relevant words in image regions.
Quantitatively, we demonstrate that our I2DFormer significantly outperforms
previous unsupervised semantic embeddings under both zero-shot and generalized
zero-shot learning settings on three public datasets. Qualitatively, we show
that our method leads to highly interpretable results where document words can
be grounded in the image regions.

performance in the blind single image super-resolution (SISR) task, most of
them mainly focus on heuristically constructing diverse network architectures
and put less emphasis on the explicit embedding of the physical generation
mechanism between blur kernels and high-resolution (HR) images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a model-driven deep neural network, called KXNet, for
blind SISR. Specifically, to solve the classical SISR model, we propose a
simple-yet-effective iterative algorithm. Then by unfolding the involved
iterative steps into the corresponding network module, we naturally construct
the KXNet. The main specificity of the proposed KXNet is that the entire
learning process is fully and explicitly integrated with the inherent physical
mechanism underlying this SISR task. Thus, the learned blur kernel has clear
physical patterns and the mutually iterative process between blur kernel and HR
image can soundly guide the KXNet to be evolved in the right direction.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data finely demonstrate the
superior accuracy and generality of our method beyond the current
representative state-of-the-art blind SISR methods. Code is available at:

for computer vision has greatly promoted the performance of medical image
segmentation (MedISeg). However, the recent MedISeg publications usually focus
on presentations of the major contributions (e.g., network architectures,
training strategies, and loss functions) while unwittingly ignoring some
marginal implementation details (also known as ""tricks""), leading to a
potential problem of the unfair experimental result comparisons. In this paper,
we collect a series of MedISeg tricks for different model implementation phases
(i.e., pre-training model, data pre-processing, data augmentation, model
implementation, model inference, and result post-processing), and
experimentally explore the effectiveness of these tricks on the consistent
baseline models. Compared to paper-driven surveys that only blandly focus on
the advantages and limitation analyses of segmentation models, our work
provides a large number of solid experiments and is more technically operable.
With the extensive experimental results on both the representative 2D and 3D
medical image datasets, we explicitly clarify the effect of these tricks.
Moreover, based on the surveyed tricks, we also open-sourced a strong MedISeg
repository, where each of its components has the advantage of plug-and-play. We
believe that this milestone work not only completes a comprehensive and
complementary survey of the state-of-the-art MedISeg approaches, but also
offers a practical guide for addressing the future medical image processing
challenges including but not limited to small dataset learning, class imbalance
learning, multi-modality learning, and domain adaptation. The code has been

automaton (DFA) of a regular language using membership and equivalence queries.
Its probabilistic approximatively correct (PAC) version substitutes an
equivalence query by a large enough set of random membership queries to get a
high level confidence to the answer. Thus it can be applied to any kind of
(also non-regular) device and may be viewed as an algorithm for synthesizing an
automaton abstracting the behavior of the device based on observations. Here we
are interested on how Angluin's PAC learning algorithm behaves for devices
which are obtained from a DFA by introducing some noise. More precisely we
study whether Angluin's algorithm reduces the noise and produces a DFA closer
to the original one than the noisy device. We propose several ways to introduce
the noise: (1) the noisy device inverts the classification of words w.r.t. the
DFA with a small probability, (2) the noisy device modifies with a small
probability the letters of the word before asking its classification w.r.t. the
DFA, and (3) the noisy device combines the classification of a word w.r.t. the
DFA and its classification w.r.t. a counter automaton. Our experiments were
performed on several hundred DFAs.
  Our main contributions, bluntly stated, consist in showing that: (1)
Angluin's algorithm behaves well whenever the noisy device is produced by a

the existence of a parameter valuation for which a Kripke structure satisfies a

a fragment of PHS which subsumes parametric LTL and for which model checking

implicitly during the fusion process. Under this setting, these 2D spatial
reasoning approaches cannot distinguish the fine-grain spatial relations
between visual objects and scene texts on the same image plane, thereby
impairing the interpretability and performance of TextVQA models. In this
paper, we introduce 3D geometric information into a human-like spatial

receptive field sizes while neglecting small receptive fields. Thus, it is a
challenging problem to effectively construct adaptive neural networks for
recognizing various spatial-scale objects. To tackle this issue, we first
introduce a new attention dimension, i.e., depth, in addition to existing
attention dimensions such as channel, spatial, and branch, and present a novel
selective depth attention network to symmetrically handle multi-scale objects
in various vision tasks. Specifically, the blocks within each stage of a given
neural network, i.e., ResNet, output hierarchical feature maps sharing the same
resolution but with different receptive field sizes. Based on this structural
property, we design a stage-wise building module, namely SDA, which includes a
trunk branch and a SE-like attention branch. The block outputs of the trunk
branch are fused to globally guide their depth attention allocation through the
attention branch. According to the proposed attention mechanism, we can
dynamically select different depth features, which contributes to adaptively
adjusting the receptive field sizes for the variable-sized input objects. In
this way, the cross-block information interaction leads to a long-range
dependency along the depth direction. Compared with other multi-scale
approaches, our SDA method combines multiple receptive fields from previous
blocks into the stage output, thus offering a wider and richer range of
effective receptive fields. Moreover, our method can be served as a pluggable
module to other multi-scale networks as well as attention networks, coined as
SDA-$x$Net. Their combination further extends the range of the effective
receptive fields towards small receptive fields, enabling interpretable neural
networks. Our source code is available at

compare half-duplex communication, existential B-boundedness, and
k-synchronisability. These restrictions do not prevent the communication
channels from growing arbitrarily large but still restrict the power of the
model. Each restriction gives rise to a set of languages so, for every pair of
restrictions, we check whether one subsumes the other or if they are
incomparable. We investigate their relationship in two different contexts:
first, the one of communicating state machines, and, second, the one of
communication protocol specifications using high-level message sequence charts.
Surprisingly, these two contexts yield different conclusions. In addition, we
integrate multiparty session types, another approach to specify communication
protocols, into our classification. We show that multiparty session type

show this result, we provide the first formal embedding of multiparty session

intelligently designed multiple deep neural networks (DNN) units. At the BS, a

channel state information. At each user, the channel feedback operation is
carried out in a distributed manner by an individual user DNN. Then, another BS

precoding matrices. A joint training algorithm is proposed to optimize all DNN
units in an end-to-end manner. In addition, a training strategy which can avoid

based on the structure of the LDBA. Theoretical guarantees under proper
assumptions ensure the convergence of the RL algorithm to an optimal policy
that maximises the satisfaction probability. We present case studies to
demonstrate the applicability, ease of use, scalability, and performance of
LCRL. Owing to the LDBA-guided exploration and LCRL model-free architecture, we
observe robust performance, which also scales well when compared to standard RL

characteristics of many real-world robot tasks. The partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) provides a principled mathematical framework for
modeling and solving robot decision and control tasks under uncertainty. Over
the last decade, it has seen many successful applications, spanning
localization and navigation, search and tracking, autonomous driving,
multi-robot systems, manipulation, and human-robot interaction. This survey
aims to bridge the gap between the development of POMDP models and algorithms
at one end and application to diverse robot decision tasks at the other. It
analyzes the characteristics of these tasks and connects them with the
mathematical and algorithmic properties of the POMDP framework for effective
modeling and solution. For practitioners, the survey provides some of the key
task characteristics in deciding when and how to apply POMDPs to robot tasks
successfully. For POMDP algorithm designers, the survey provides new insights
into the unique challenges of applying POMDPs to robot systems and points to
promising new directions for further research.

the outer solution, the viscous layer and the Knudsen layer. Starting from the
BCs of the moment system, we propose a matching requirement and construct BCs
for the Navier-Stokes equations. The obtained BCs contain the effect of
second-order terms on the velocity slip and temperature jump. For the
illustrative case of the Couette flow, we prove the validity of the constructed
BCs through the error estimates. Meanwhile, numerical tests are presented to
show the performance of the constructed BCs.

Moreover, we establish several lower bounds for this task which hold for any

  Data-Free Knowledge Distillation",Accepted to NeurIPS 2022,,,,cs.CV cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Data-free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) has attracted attention recently
thanks to its appealing capability of transferring knowledge from a teacher
network to a student network without using training data. The main idea is to
use a generator to synthesize data for training the student. As the generator
gets updated, the distribution of synthetic data will change. Such distribution
shift could be large if the generator and the student are trained
adversarially, causing the student to forget the knowledge it acquired at
previous steps. To alleviate this problem, we propose a simple yet effective
method called Momentum Adversarial Distillation (MAD) which maintains an
exponential moving average (EMA) copy of the generator and uses synthetic
samples from both the generator and the EMA generator to train the student.
Since the EMA generator can be considered as an ensemble of the generator's old
versions and often undergoes a smaller change in updates compared to the
generator, training on its synthetic samples can help the student recall the
past knowledge and prevent the student from adapting too quickly to new updates
of the generator. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets including big
datasets like ImageNet and Places365 demonstrate the superior performance of
MAD over competing methods for handling the large distribution shift problem.
Our method also compares favorably to existing DFKD methods and even achieves
state-of-the-art results in some cases.

generalize to new unseen bots, thus proposing a solution to the generalization

to power grid reliability. There have been increasing interests in utilizing
financial tools, such as insurance, to help end-users hedge the potential risk
of lost load due to renewable energy variability. With insurance, a user pays a
premium fee to the utility, so that he will get compensated in case his demand
is not fully satisfied. A proper insurance design needs to resolve the
following two challenges: (i) users' reliability preference is private
information; and (ii) the insurance design is tightly coupled with the
renewable energy investment decision. To address these challenges, we adopt the
contract theory to elicit users' private reliability preferences, and we study
how the utility can jointly optimize the insurance contract and the planning of
renewable energy. A key analytical challenge is that the joint optimization of
the insurance design and the planning of renewables is non-convex. We resolve
this difficulty by revealing important structural properties of the optimal
solution, using the help of two benchmark problems: the no-insurance benchmark
and the social-optimum benchmark. Compared with the no-insurance benchmark, we
prove that the social cost and users' total energy cost are always no larger
under the optimal contract. Simulation results show that the largest benefit of
the insurance contract is achieved at a medium electricity-bill price together
with a low type heterogeneity and a high renewable uncertainty.

robustness with the guidance of a few collected and misclassified examples that
are degraded by some real-world unknown corruptions having a specific pattern
(e.g., noise, blur, etc.). To this end, we first conduct an empirical study to
validate that the model architectures can be definitely related to the
corruption patterns. Surprisingly, by just adding a few corrupted and
misclassified examples (e.g., $10^3$ examples) to the clean training dataset
(e.g., $5.0 \times 10^4$ examples), we can refine the model architecture and
enhance the robustness significantly. To make it more practical, the key
problem, i.e., how to select the proper failure examples for the effective NAS
guidance, should be carefully investigated. Then, we propose a novel
core-failure-set guided DARTS that embeds a K-center-greedy algorithm for DARTS

inference system by transmitting task-relevant information to the receiver.
However, only transmitting task-relevant information without introducing any
redundancy may cause robustness issues in learning due to the channel
variations, and the JSCC which directly maps the source data into continuous
channel input symbols poses compatibility issues on existing digital
communication systems. In this paper, we address these two issues by first
investigating the inherent tradeoff between the informativeness of the encoded
representations and the robustness to information distortion in the received
representations, and then propose a task-oriented communication scheme with
digital modulation, named discrete task-oriented JSCC (DT-JSCC), where the
transmitter encodes the features into a discrete representation and transmits
it to the receiver with the digital modulation scheme. In the DT-JSCC scheme,
we develop a robust encoding framework, named robust information bottleneck

derive a tractable variational upper bound of the RIB objective function using
the variational approximation to overcome the computational intractability of
mutual information. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed

  Moreover, we observe that previous methods for keypoint detection work on a
representation (such as the time surface) that integrates events over a period
of time. Since this integration is required, we claim it is better to predict
the keypoints' trajectories for the time period rather than single locations,
as done in previous approaches. We predict these trajectories in the form of a
series of heatmaps for the integration time period. This improves the keypoint
localization.
  Our architecture can also be kept very simple, which results in very fast
inference times. We demonstrate our approach on the HVGA ATIS Corner dataset as
well as ""The Event-Camera Dataset and Simulator"" dataset, and show it results
in keypoint tracks that are three times longer and nearly twice as accurate as
the best previous state-of-the-art methods. We believe our approach can be
generalized to other event-based camera problems, and we release our source
code to encourage other authors to explore it.

achieves promising results through a set of object queries and proposal boxes
updated in the cascaded training manner. However, due to the sparse nature and
the one-to-one relation between the query and its attending region, it heavily
depends on the self attention, which is usually inaccurate in the early
training stage. Moreover, in a scene of dense objects, the object query
interacts with many irrelevant ones, reducing its uniqueness and harming the
performance. This paper proposes to use IoU between different boxes as a prior
for the value routing in self attention. The original attention matrix
multiplies the same size matrix computed from the IoU of proposal boxes, and
they determine the routing scheme so that the irrelevant features can be
suppressed. Furthermore, to accurately extract features for both classification
and regression, we add two lightweight projection heads to provide the dynamic
channel masks based on object query, and they multiply with the output from
dynamic convs, making the results suitable for the two different tasks. We
validate the proposed scheme on different datasets, including MS-COCO and
CrowdHuman, showing that it significantly improves the performance and
increases the model convergence speed.

at the root and periodically need to return to the supply station. Our goal is
to design off-line strategies to efficiently cover the tree with $k$ small

maximum collective time is the maximum time spent by a robot needs to finish
its assigned task (assuming that all the robots start at the same time); the
total traveled distance is the sum of the lengths of all the covering walks.

practices to make predictions and classifications based on data representations
of phenomena, has been applied to domains as disparate as criminal justice,
commerce, medicine, media and the arts, mechanical engineering, among others.
How has machine intelligence become able to glide so freely across, and to make
such waves for, these domains? In this dissertation, I take up that question by
ethnographically engaging with how the authority of machine learning has been
constructed such that it can influence so many domains, and I investigate what
the consequences are of it being able to do so. By examining the workplace
practices of the applied machine learning researchers who produce machine
intelligence, those they work with, and the artifacts they produce. The
dissertation begins by arguing that machine intelligence proceeds from a naive
form of empiricism with ties to positivist intellectual traditions of the 17th
and 18th centuries. This naive empiricism eschews other forms of knowledge and
theory formation in order for applied machine learning researchers to enact
data performances that bring objects of analysis into existence as entities
capable of being subjected to machine intelligence. By data performances, I
mean generative enactments which bring into existence that which machine
intelligence purports to analyze or describe. The enactment of data
performances is analyzed as an agential cut into a representational field that
produces both stable claims about the world and the interpretive frame in which
those claims can hold true. The dissertation also examines how machine
intelligence depends upon a range of accommodations from other institutions and
organizations, from data collection and processing to organizational
commitments to support the work of applied machine learning researchers.

attention in academic researches and clinical applications. Nevertheless, the
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) diagnosis system heavily relies on the
well-labeled lesion dataset, and the sensitivity to the variation of data
distribution also restricts the potential application of CNNs in CAD.
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods are developed to solve the
expensive annotation and domain gaps problem and have achieved remarkable
success in medical image analysis. Yet existing UDA approaches only adapt
knowledge learned from the source lesion domain to a single target lesion
domain, which is against the clinical scenario: the new unlabeled target
domains to be diagnosed always arrive in an online and continual manner.
Moreover, the performance of existing approaches degrades dramatically on
previously learned target lesion domains, due to the newly learned knowledge
overwriting the previously learned knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting).
To deal with the above issues, we develop a meta-adaptation framework named
Consecutive Lesion Knowledge Meta-Adaptation (CLKM), which mainly consists of
Semantic Adaptation Phase (SAP) and Representation Adaptation Phase (RAP) to
learn the diagnosis model in an online and continual manner. In the SAP, the

entropy model. When the network is sparse, we derive an analytical expression
for the degree distribution of the model that depends on just the constraints

maximum-entropy data-driven spatial social networks, where each block
identifies vertices having similar position (e.g., residence) and age, and
where the expected block-to-block adjacency matrix can be inferred from the
available data. In this case, the sparse-regime approximation coincides with a

is usually limited to a closed reference vocabulary. In this paper, we propose
a few-shot learning paradigm for spotting sequences of a few characters
(N-gram) that requires a small amount of labelled training data. We exhibit
that recognition of important n-grams could reduce the system's dependency on
vocabulary. In this case, an out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word in an input

the efficiency of learning, a growing line of reinforcement learning research
focuses on risk functionals that depend on the entire distribution of returns.
Recent work on \emph{off-policy risk assessment} (OPRA) for contextual bandits
introduced consistent estimators for the target policy's CDF of returns along
with finite sample guarantees that extend to (and hold simultaneously over) all
risk. In this paper, we lift OPRA to Markov decision processes (MDPs), where
importance sampling (IS) CDF estimators suffer high variance on longer
trajectories due to small effective sample size. To mitigate these problems, we
incorporate model-based estimation to develop the first doubly robust (DR)
estimator for the CDF of returns in MDPs. This estimator enjoys significantly
less variance and, when the model is well specified, achieves the Cramer-Rao
variance lower bound. Moreover, for many risk functionals, the downstream
estimates enjoy both lower bias and lower variance. Additionally, we derive the
first minimax lower bounds for off-policy CDF and risk estimation, which match
our error bounds up to a constant factor. Finally, we demonstrate the precision
of our DR CDF estimates experimentally on several different environments.

formerly proven invariants should be retained - when they are not affected by

these RL agents against some baseline agents. We also compared the RL agents

many areas of scientific computing, rapidly increases the energy consumption of
modern high-performance computing systems. An appealing and possibly more
sustainable alternative is provided by novel neuromorphic paradigms, which
directly implement ANNs in hardware. However, little is known about the actual
benefits of running ANNs on neuromorphic hardware for use cases in scientific
computing. Here we present a methodology for measuring the energy cost and
compute time for inference tasks with ANNs on conventional hardware. In
addition, we have designed an architecture for these tasks and estimate the
same metrics based on a state-of-the-art analog in-memory computing (AIMC)
platform, one of the key paradigms in neuromorphic computing. Both
methodologies are compared for a use case in quantum many-body physics in two
dimensional condensed matter systems and for anomaly detection at 40 MHz rates
at the Large Hadron Collider in particle physics. We find that AIMC can achieve
up to one order of magnitude shorter computation times than conventional
hardware, at an energy cost that is up to three orders of magnitude smaller.
This suggests great potential for faster and more sustainable scientific
computing with neuromorphic hardware.

some cases outperforming humans in tasks that were believed impossible for
machines. However, achieving human-level performance when dealing with
physically interactive tasks, e.g., in contact-rich robotic manipulation, is
still a big challenge. It is well known that regulating the Cartesian impedance
for such operations is of utmost importance for their successful execution.
Approaches like reinforcement Learning (RL) can be a promising paradigm for
solving such problems. More precisely, approaches that use task-agnostic expert
demonstrations to bootstrap learning when solving new tasks have a huge
potential since they can exploit large datasets. However, existing data
collection systems are expensive, complex, or do not allow for impedance
regulation. This work represents a first step towards a data collection
framework suitable for collecting large datasets of impedance-based expert
demonstrations compatible with the RL problem formulation, where a novel action
space is used. The framework is designed according to requirements acquired
after an extensive analysis of available data collection frameworks for
robotics manipulation. The result is a low-cost and open-access tele-impedance

evolution of knowledge. In software engineering (SE), there are several
classifications that describe the nature of SE research. Regarding the
consolidation of the large body of classified knowledge in SE research, a
generally applicable classification scheme is crucial. Moreover, the
commonalities and differences among different classification schemes have
rarely been studied. Due to the fact that classifications are documented
textual, it is hard to catalog, reuse, and compare them. To the best of our
knowledge, there is no research work so far that addresses documentation and
systematic investigation of classifications in SE meta-research. Objective: We
aim to construct a unified, generally applicable classification scheme for SE
meta-research by collecting and documenting existing classification schemes and
unifying their classes and categories. Method: Our execution plan is divided
into three phases: construction, validation, and evaluation phase. For the
construction phase, we perform a literature review to identify, collect, and
analyze a set of established SE research classifications. In the validation
phase, we analyze individual categories and classes of included papers. We use
quantitative metrics from literature to conduct and assess the unification
process to build a generally applicable classification scheme for SE research.
Lastly, we investigate the applicability of the unified scheme. Therefore, we
perform a workshop session followed by user studies w.r.t. investigations about
reliability, correctness, and ease of use.

interpretability or provide incomplete rationales by only highlighting parts of
the source document. To this end, we propose the Summarization Program (SP), an
interpretable modular framework consisting of an (ordered) list of binary
trees, each encoding the step-by-step generative process of an abstractive
summary sentence from the source document. A Summarization Program contains one
root node per summary sentence, and a distinct tree connects each summary
sentence (root node) to the document sentences (leaf nodes) from which it is
derived, with the connecting nodes containing intermediate generated sentences.
Edges represent different modular operations involved in summarization such as
sentence fusion, compression, and paraphrasing. We first propose an efficient
best-first search method over neural modules, SP-Search that identifies SPs for
human summaries by directly optimizing for ROUGE scores. Next, using these
programs as automatic supervision, we propose seq2seq models that generate
Summarization Programs, which are then executed to obtain final summaries. We
demonstrate that SP-Search effectively represents the generative process behind
human summaries using modules that are typically faithful to their intended
behavior. We also conduct a simulation study to show that Summarization
Programs improve the interpretability of summarization models by allowing
humans to better simulate model reasoning. Summarization Programs constitute a
promising step toward interpretable and modular abstractive summarization, a
complex task previously addressed primarily through blackbox end-to-end neural
systems. Our code is available at

hand motions and avoid collisions inside the formation.
  Several topologies of the impedance connection between swarm units were
investigated in this research. The experiment, in which drones performed a
point following task on a square trajectory in real-time, revealed that drones
connected in a Star topology performed the trajectory with low mean positional
error (RMSE decreased by 20.6% in comparison with other impedance topologies

method needs to mimic the behaviors of physically-based relighting. Second, the
output has to be photorealistic. To meet the first condition, we propose to
train the relighting network with training data generated by a virtual light
stage that performs physically-based rendering on various 3D synthetic humans
under different environment maps. To meet the second condition, we develop a
novel synthetic-to-real approach to bring photorealism to the relighting
network output. In addition to achieving SOTA results, our approach offers
several advantages over the prior methods, including controllable glares on
glasses and more temporally-consistent results for relighting videos.

reduce numerical error, and remove required user-tuning in the Marginal
Unbiased Score Expansion (MUSE) algorithm for hierarchical Bayesian inference.
We demonstrate these improvements on three representative inference problems:
1) an extended Neal's funnel 2) Bayesian neural networks, and 3) probabilistic
principal component analysis. On our particular test cases, MUSE with implicit
differentiation is faster than Hamiltonian Monte Carlo by factors of 155, 397,
and 5, respectively, or factors of 65, 278, and 1 without implicit
differentiation, and yields good approximate marginal posteriors. The Julia and
Python MUSE packages have been updated to use implicit differentiation, and can
solve problems defined by hand or with any of a number of popular probabilistic
programming languages and automatic differentiation backends.

individual robots is a very significant component. The availability of a
centralized infrastructure can guarantee an optimal allocation of the tasks.
However, in many important scenarios such as search and rescue, exploration,
disaster-management, war-field, etc., on-the-fly allocation of the dynamic
tasks to the robots in a decentralized fashion is the only possible option.
Efficient communication among the robots plays a crucial role in any such
decentralized setting. Existing works on distributed Multi-Robot Task
Allocation (MRTA) either assume that the network is available or a naive
communication paradigm is used. On the contrary, in most of these scenarios,
the network infrastructure is either unstable or unavailable and ad-hoc
networking is the only resort. Recent developments in synchronous-transmission
(ST) based wireless communication protocols are shown to be more efficient than
the traditional asynchronous transmission-based protocols in ad hoc networks
such as Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)/Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
The current work is the first effort that utilizes ST for MRTA. Specifically,
we propose an algorithm that efficiently adapts ST-based many-to-many
interaction and minimizes the information exchange to reach a consensus for
task allocation. We showcase the efficacy of the proposed algorithm through an
extensive simulation-based study of its latency and energy-efficiency under
different settings.

decompose the explana-tory variables into different levels, extract their

this contextual information can be very useful in demand forecasting with large
demand volatility or intermittent demand patterns. Convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in many fields where important
information in data is represented by images. CNNs are powerful because they
accept samples as images and use adjacent voxel sets to integrate
multi-dimensional important information and learn important features. On the
other hand, although the demand-forecasting model has been improved, the input
data is still limited in its tabular form and is not suitable for CNN modeling.
In this study, we propose a Tab2vox neural architecture search (NAS) model as a
method to convert a high-dimensional tabular sam-ple into a well-formed 3D
voxel image and use it in a 3D CNN network. For each image repre-sentation, the

techniques using tabular data, and the latest image transformation studies.

  Learning via Principal Angles Between Client Data Subspaces",,,,,cs.LG cs.AI cs.DC math.OC,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Clustered federated learning (FL) has been shown to produce promising results
by grouping clients into clusters. This is especially effective in scenarios
where separate groups of clients have significant differences in the
distributions of their local data. Existing clustered FL algorithms are
essentially trying to group together clients with similar distributions so that
clients in the same cluster can leverage each other's data to better perform
federated learning. However, prior clustered FL algorithms attempt to learn
these distribution similarities indirectly during training, which can be quite
time consuming as many rounds of federated learning may be required until the
formation of clusters is stabilized. In this paper, we propose a new approach
to federated learning that directly aims to efficiently identify distribution
similarities among clients by analyzing the principal angles between the client
data subspaces. Each client applies a truncated singular value decomposition
(SVD) step on its local data in a single-shot manner to derive a small set of
principal vectors, which provides a signature that succinctly captures the main
characteristics of the underlying distribution. This small set of principal
vectors is provided to the server so that the server can directly identify
distribution similarities among the clients to form clusters. This is achieved
by comparing the similarities of the principal angles between the client data
subspaces spanned by those principal vectors. The approach provides a simple,
yet effective clustered FL framework that addresses a broad range of data
heterogeneity issues beyond simpler forms of Non-IIDness like label skews. Our
clustered FL approach also enables convergence guarantees for non-convex
objectives. Our code is available at https://github.com/MMorafah/PACFL.

single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is governed by the
autocorrelations of the observed, randomly-oriented, noisy projection images.
In this work, we consider the effect of imposing sparsity priors on the
molecule. We use techniques from signal processing, optimization, and applied
algebraic geometry to obtain new theoretical and computational contributions
for this challenging non-linear inverse problem with sparsity constraints. We
prove that molecular structures modeled as sums of idealized point masses are
uniquely determined by the second-order autocorrelation of their projection
images, implying that the sample complexity is proportional to the square of
the variance of the noise. This theory improves upon the non-sparse case, where
the third-order autocorrelation is required for uniformly-oriented particle
images and the sample complexity scales with the cube of the noise variance.
Furthermore, we build a computational framework to reconstruct molecular
structures which are sparse in the wavelet basis. This method combines the
sparse representation for the molecule with projection-based techniques used
for phase retrieval in X-ray crystallography.

  Regularization",,,,,cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Federated Learning (FL) seeks to distribute model training across local
clients without collecting data in a centralized data-center, hence removing
data-privacy concerns. A major challenge for FL is data heterogeneity (where
each client's data distribution can differ) as it can lead to weight divergence
among local clients and slow global convergence. The current SOTA FL methods
designed for data heterogeneity typically impose regularization to limit the
impact of non-IID data and are stateful algorithms, i.e., they maintain local
statistics over time. While effective, these approaches can only be used for a
special case of FL involving only a small number of reliable clients. For the
more typical applications of FL where the number of clients is large (e.g.,
edge-device and mobile applications), these methods cannot be applied,
motivating the need for a stateless approach to heterogeneous FL which can be
used for any number of clients. We derive a first-order gradient regularization
to penalize inconsistent local updates due to local data heterogeneity.
Specifically, to mitigate weight divergence, we introduce a first-order
approximation of the global data distribution into local objectives, which
intuitively penalizes updates in the opposite direction of the global update.
The end result is a stateless FL algorithm that achieves 1) significantly
faster convergence (i.e., fewer communication rounds) and 2) higher overall
converged performance than SOTA methods under non-IID data distribution.
Importantly, our approach does not impose unrealistic limits on the client
size, enabling learning from a large number of clients as is typical in most FL
applications.

well-formed and nonsensical items. We compare the performance of BERT-base to
that of humans, obtained with a psycholinguistic online crowdsourcing
experiment. We find that BERT and humans are both sensitive to our semantic
manipulation: They fail more often when presented with nonsensical items,
especially when their syntactic structure features an attractor (a noun phrase
between the subject and the verb that has not the same number as the subject).
We also find that the effect of meaningfulness on SVA errors is stronger for
BERT than for humans, showing higher lexical sensitivity of the former on this
